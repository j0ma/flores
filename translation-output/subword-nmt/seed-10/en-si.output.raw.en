while six people died when building the ship , one person died when it was about to launch the ship by falling a beam on to the head .
in the ship if it was filled the maximum amount it can carry these boats would only suffice for one-third of that whole amount .
some bodies that sank along with the ship had been ravaged and dispersed by the ocean waves , and so could not be collected at all .
this system consisted of all-round pipes , taps and valves .
from the amount onboard the ship about one third had saved their lives .
the ship 's crew was categorized into main three sections .
it was a great help for them , publishing the name list of the passengers .

the structure of the ship was designed so that the base acted as the central spine while the body acted as the rib .
the next day a wreath placement and a musical show were held .
later , reports were confirmed that titanic was shipwrecked with most of the passengers .
the ship was examined for nearly twelve hours , by running in different speeds , doing sudden turns and stops .

the purpose of titanic was to give it 's passengers the utmost possible comfort and luxury .
the number of luggage carried by passengers is also huge .
a short while later , the ship sailed from belfast for the last time and was heading for the southampton port .
the first released reports were confusingly contradictory .

for this boilers , the required amount of power is obtained by using coal .
this letter never reached its intended recipient and the returned letters are presently displayed at the liverpool museum .
while these changes caused the titanic ship to increase in weight , it also gave her the blessing of being the largest ship to sail the seas in her day .
all these engines contribute to rotating the tail flaps of the ship .
based on this event , most of the books , films , songs and games have been released .

the ship was then taken out of the dockyard to a jetty , to modify the engine , smoke window , superstructure , and interior designs .
special trains were scheduled from london and paris for passengers to get in touch with the harbours of southampton and cheburg respectively .
thousands of books , films , exhibitions , and souvenirs that were launched around the world have contributed in carrying on its memory .
eventhough the protest stopped a few days before tge ship sailed it failed to make a great impact on the increase in the number of passengers .
among these two steam-powered engines , one had always been functional , and the other was ready as an additional engine .
walking or lazily wandering on the open floor was a normal thing .
three classes were given required facilities to spend the time leisurely .
third class passengers that accounted for a large value numerically were first admitted into the ship .
the tourist post office and even the squash sport complex were located here .
most families in southampton has lost the breadwinner .
even the names of some passengers who cancelled their traveling season were included in the list .

every ship had undertakers , priests and chemicals to preserve dead bodies .
every boat , was equipped with water , food , warm clothes and lifesaving belts and ropes were there to rescue additional people on the water .
it 's purpose is to find out what happened and investigate how to prevent such disasters in the future .
above all floors there were four steam pipes and out of them only three really operated .
people gathered near all the newspaper offices in the hope of the hottest news reports .
by using a turbine with a cylinder engine could reduce fuel consumption and increase power .
it consisted of two four cylinder-ed tri-expansion steam engines and a centralized steam turbine .

today the half of the primary schools in thailand are located inside the temples .
today , there are more than 100 millions of theravada buddhists all over the world .
after education priests leave ordination in order to fulfill duties to the family or due to sickness .
gradually theravada buddhism spread to thailand , laos , and cambodia .
for others , it is considered that it will take few lifetimes to perceive more and more knowledge in every life and to understand the reality .
attempt to blend with other buddhist traditions .
with the rise of the dawn monks who walk barefoot make a pindapatha journey to nearby villages with their chalice to ask for alms .
as arahant , they do not live as a layman 's life in a house .
arahats are the ones who comprehended nibbana according to buddha 's dhamma
ultimate end : the noble eightfold path that is more bias to teaching and lack of focus on other basic teachings
they say that indian influence mentioned in ashoka pillars on buddhist missionary mission is shown here .
there is a contemplation of the information about the dhamma in each of the two books of the sutta and the vinaya .
religious practices , duties and functions are held in ashram 's with the unity of the society .
the eightfold path noble teaches the path to weaken defilements and to completely remove them .
it is the responsibility of laity to ensure that there is no suffering created for the monks due to shortage of food , clothing , temples and medicine .
monks do not set tile limit for walking or sitting meditations .
if explained simply , problem , reason and solution is the path to the solving the problem .
there is not much information about later theravada bhuddhism in india .
after this , inter-research , an analysis , personal experience and knowledge are used to understand the true nature of defilement .
theravada gives less value to that than t the mahayana and the vajrayana .
due to a person who enters in to the higher ordination , their parents will also receive merit rewards .
that is , living in the natural places like forests , mountains and caves .
according to theravada buddhists this happened during the 4th dhamma convocation in sri lanka .
it was not only about ethics and a set of policies .
if it was told in a formal way , the buddha started the circle of the dhamma .
it is a religion that some people in some areas of the south-east asian region , such as shan and tha 'li of china believe .
it was a tradition from the first century alexandria situated in the coast .
it is the existence - the longing for the vanity and the longing for self - defense .
it is seen as different other forms including the desire for the existence .
this was the first time it was had , not only in the western but also in the eastern society .
from that rebirth , illness , aging , and death can be avoided .
another group of westerners sought out the truth and were able to print the pali sutta and later add it to the internet .
then the mind can be used to explore the true nature of the reality .
or else by exploring the truth directly it is possible to find happiness in a way that budhdha taught by following the noble eight fold path .
also , theravadins believe that those who are not acquainted with dharma think that their body is their own and become slaves of it .
but the procedures followed within the monastery are different .
but it is not rare staying longer or short period than that in ordination .
but such devotees attain the status of arhat closer to death or join the religious order after obtaining dhamma awareness .
but boys of a younger age than that can be added to the ordination as samaneras .
but it seems that they did not change the part that they received in the earlier era .
but both those parties act as religious teachers within the society .
but these three classifications are not accepted by all academic scholars .
the tripitaka was carried over centuries in the oral tradition of religious beliefs .
therefore one should do is to prepare the mind without getting caught to ties .
so sadness is created first by ourselves .
those monks become masters themselves because of their meditating experience .
it is believed that theravada has been traditionally maintained since the orthodoxy of those countries was enforced .
although differences can be seen between them , there have been amalgamations between them as well .
they includes visions , sounds , touches , flavors , smells and mental concepts .
they are a collection made by the people who were involved in teaching in this tradition .
those are written by referring ancient documents which were written in old sinhalese language .
there are three types of : seala , or discipline , samadhi or the mental training and knowledge or the development of knowledge .
they who are monks consider a man who marries as a ' mature ' person to consider getting ready for a happy marriage .
they can not get the man out of the cycle of recurrence , that is , birth , disease , aging , and death .
they can be born at least seven times in the carnal world before achieving nirwana .
as they travel a long way , they walk to a place where they feel , barefoot .
he insists that all three of these terms are contained in the pali thripitakaya .
he concludes : the theravadans , then , could have been adding pieces for long time to tripitaka .
the appointment of higher ordination as a monk even for a short period is considered to be very virtuous .
however , the documents related to theravada tradition has given priority for set of practices .
however these notes do not receive the important place which thripitaka received .
those who are without knowledge of dharma are trapped with defilement .
the activities done by the laymen were not ones that had room for the study of the pali tripitaka or the traditions of buddhist meditation .
one of the duties of laymen is according to the teachings of lord buddha fulfilling the needs of bikkus and bikkunis .
the traditional acceptance is that the role of the laity is to do meritorious act ..
in the condition of wisdom , physical sensory gates blot away .
one should take the responsibility of their own action is depicted in pali as ' karma ' and in sanskrit as ' kamma ' .
the therawada tradition among other traditions took the first steps to record the thripitaka completely .

during three months of rainy season in thailand and burma young men engage in ordination .
in short the third noble truth is the way to eliminate reasons for greed and bad deeds .
though some do not know greatly about the canon , there are people that know of the basic buddhist dharma s .
most of the majority gathered in tripitaka are not the details in " theravada . "
theravada buddhism is a religion beleived by many in a number of south east asian countries including cambodia , laos , burma and thailand .
theravadha philosophy is a fundamental analysis of life .
in theravada , the arahats who achieve nirvana are respected and regarded as liberated in the same way as the buddha .
according to therawada buddhism the cause of sorrow for all mankind is craving .
many countries and people around the world follow theravada buddhism .
nibbana , the highest achievement of theravada is attained by studying and practicing good virtue in day to day life .
in recent years , theravada has become more popular in the western world .
in the theravada faith , no buddhas , gods or other clergy can bring awakening to humans .
it is considered that , the pali tri-pitaka which is used by theravada buddhists was brought here during the period of emperor ashoka .
according to the theravadins , the buddha is a super talented noble person and was respected .
theravada buddha is only the teacher who taught the path of noble eightfold path
therawada people believe in lord buddhas such as maithree who is yet to be born as mentioned in the pali sutta pitakas such as maithiya .
by following the procedures of theravada a chance to reach four paths of fruition that leads to liberation will be opened .
in many southern asian countries it is considered as a debt paid for their parents for raising them .
throughout southern asia it is not very unpopular to leave the life of a monk .
those who view god and others as sacred are those who face anger , envy , hatred , avenge , covetousness , greed , ignorance , and death
focus is given to the tradition of forests rather than the tradition of the dhamma is aimed at gaining supernatural powers from pali sources and folk tradition .
theravadans believe that the world is being experienced by these six sensing gates ( eyes , ears , nose , tongue , touch , mind ) . even without being unenlightened .
the people who don 't understand the dhamma , keep the sin because the don 't understand the truth .
the road to nirvana , or the noble eight fold path , is sometimes referred to as the dhammanudhamma patipada. which consists of three noble disciplines .
a monk who obtain the ordination and lives in the woods is usually considered as having ability to successfully reach the target called nibbana .
a person who reached to the state of nibbana is named as arhath .
with the aim of not finding nirvana , they can be used for the happiness of their life by lay people .
there is no a certain type of body , the identity is always changing , and it is difficult for many to be able to understand this and because of that the sorrow creates .
in the past decade , theravada has been renaissance in western countries and in india in where it was originated .
according to the opinion of the majority of scholars there were only the first two pitaka present in the first darma sangaye ,
pali abhidhamma pitakha was not accepted by those who were not from the theravada tradition .
pali is the most respected dharma book in the theravada sārupā that take precedence over the teachings of gautama buddha .
with the translation and publication of the pali thripitakaya , for the first time in history , the pali tripitaka became available for the lay society .
in pali language the name of a male pilgrims is called upasaka .
moving out from the ordained life is considered to be disgrace .
as the clergy are not permitted to work a job , they depend on laymen to preserve their lives .
bhikkus are considered to be required to complete at least 20 years of age from the date of conception to be upgraded to the higher ordination .
according to peter harvey , it includes ideas that are inconsistent with truthful theravada ideas .
an untrained mind develops more and more sins .
in the majority of the theravada countries , it is customary to remain in higher ordination for a limited period of time .
the buddha only ranks higher than the arahant priests because he comprehended the way by himself and taught it to others .
they believe that there were other buddhas bedfore lord buddha .
there will be no result in only believing and learning about things the lord buddha said regarding true nature of the reality .
burma and cambodia stopped appointing a person for that position for a long time , but it was restarted .
burma and sri lanka has re-established the buddhism between them sufficiently .
in burma and thailand , the monasteries are still considered as places of study .
monks who meditate , those who are often considered forest monks , are thus called as they practice meditation around the forest areas .
according to the bhikku bodhi , " there are several mentions of instances in suttas and atta kathas where lay people attained the only goal of nibbana .
thai women thinks that thai men who once were monks are more suitable as marriage partners .
once the brain is sufficiently focused , the ability to lift the curtain of foolishness and see the four noble truths is presented through insightful meditation .
there is no mention of the day they lost it in the country of origin .
this tradition originated when the lord buddha allowed his son rahula to become a novice .
throughout the history of buddhism , india is very different from the relations with other countries .
this is mentioned in the thripitaka sources as buddha 's words as " what arise due to a reason , the reason can be destroyed , . "
this process should be used again and again for identifying every and all sins
according to this doctrine , an interdiscipline should have a innervision acoording to the searcher 's experience , critical exploration and criticism .
on this basis , both these sections of the tripitaka are considered to be the most ancient and most authoritative scholarly texts by buddhist scholars .
the one that follows this principle can then understand the nature of those defilements , and further understand the four noble truths , and from there reveal the road to the understanding of nirvana .
among these , the abhidhamma pitaka was considered to be added last .
when observed through this construct , skilled meditation is an enhancer of a person 's ability to concentrate the mind steadily .
it started by following a method of practicing a tradition that began in a certain geographical area
the terminal condition of a certain object is the basic reason for destroyed expectations and sadness .
sharpness may be caused by rough , medium or subtle levels .
it can be seen that the theravada tradition dispersed to burma at the time it came to sri lanka and some synergy gradually developed .
in the forest tradition , the ancient buddhist practices continue , in the same way , with regard to all aspects and the development of meditation in isolated jungles .
at the end of the rainy season , many monks go into the isolated areas ( often in to the forests ) from temples .
during the harvest time for a period of three months a monk who usually follows the daily routine wakes up before sun rise .
the idea of vipassana is " vidarshanava , " " inter-iintelligence . "
even though the vibhajjavalians have similar views to those of the old believers , they were not completely identical .
though the monastic sects in sri lanka are organized by caste , males that enter ordination can temporarily be exempted from the normal caste system .
the elites of sri lanka and southeast asia have come together with buddhism .
these are the three important characteristics of theravada ideology that explain the edict
by meditating on the satipatthāna or by controlling mind the defilements which try to take control of the mind and physical activity can be prevented .
literally , " samatha " means " making skills . "
in some instances , living and engaging in meditation is done in risky locations or places frequented by dangerous animals .
sometimes a member of the council or a senior monk holds a sermon for the visitors who visit .
it is belived in the traditions of the forest that sometimes , the bones of a buried monk who was of good character turned in to components like crystals .
some lay buddhists play a greater role in religious activities .
in some buddhist countries there is a position called sangaraja .
some monks walk from the evening to the following day morning and some times they walk two to seven hours duration .
though some forest monks spend some time studying the pali tripitaka , they spend more time on meditation activities .
traditionally , theravada buddhism has recognized and accepted a clear distinction between the two , lay and clergy parties .
traditionally , by obtaining simple prerequisites , such as the five principles given by the buddha to theravadin , simple returns can be obtained .
traditionally , temporary ordination is even more flexible in laos .
conducting a dhamma sermon four times a month by a higher ranking monk as a tradition .
a person who discards all the desires in a house is contradictory .
there is no constant existance of theories arising out of all concepts or reasons , reasons are likely to change with change or is subjected to wiparinama .
consciousness ( right mindfulness ) and the unification of the right mind ( right concentration ) are the paths that need to be observed .
sthawirawada or ' the teachings of monks ' is a continuously maintaining dharma .
vision , hearing , taste , smell , touch and consciousness .
she may have been the commander-in-chief for tutankhan , after akkanthon 's death .
if it is not for any reason , the direction of the hieroglyph in the shape of a comb has not been altered with ancechperure name .
even in amarna arts , kings have been described as amphibious .
when wu considered changing names in that period , people began to add - arton to their name- and the word " amun " was rapidly removed .
because the names of the kings have been deleted from history , manato 's record is the only ancient source of information about this .
her successor kings have used similar initials and she have not been given a royal burial .
while her tactic was successful , she was married by a hittite prince named sanansa when she came to egypt who was heir to the throne .
amun priest must have worked their since her memorial chapel was located in thebes , the religious capital of amun priests .
it is controversial as to how long there was a joint ruling and how long there was an individual ruling during her reign .
if she had added a new crest to her figure , it was a powerful evidence of the fact that nefartiti had acquired a new name and post .
since tutankhamun seems to have been appointed to the throne at a similar age , her age was not an obstacle to her appointment .
according to certain ideas , she took the name of smenkkhare and ruled the kingdom as a man .
perhaps may be because the authority of the ground was not in akknathan 's hands at the time , but was in his mysteriousness and - the ruler 's hand .
perhaps this would have been a mortuary chapel complex .
some people are citing facts that she is the queen of meritus .
she came into the throne after him under the name ankkeperure as the governess of an anarchy .
she has come to this conclusion considering the reasons that lead her to marry aai , a servant .
it is seen that she must have followed a mild principle regarding amun priest .
in her royal tombstones , it has been stated that she had died in a childbirth .
it is considered improper that she reigned the kingdom later on as a king .
after marrying her to take the throne , he used her previous masculine name as his name according to the previous information .
it seems that the cemetery has not been used , which is considered to have been designed for her .
when she came to the throne after her husband 's death , she used the royal name ankhkheperure
the fact as to whether she reigned before or after smenkhkare depends on her identity .
according to allen , if female characteristics are not considered , all three names are used for king neferneferuaten .
alan suggests that meketaten was in her third age at the time of her first representation .
very rarely , found the word ' justifiable ' with feminine characters applied soon after these nouns .
since she was raised to a position of joint reign after a short period , there was a fourth plaque carved to mention about both kings .
the egyptians have tried to conceal the facts about the " amarna " kings from the future .
among the egyptians , the leading scholars are are having different ideas .
james allen presents an interpretation on how two successors who were kings had the same name to the throne .
the reason is the goods with the name " ankhakheparure " was said to belong to smenkhkare .
each expert suggests the names of different people , and this debate is not yet over .
thereby she might have announced that she was the chosen successor / ruler of aknatan .
as a result of which she ( hatsheppsut ) is said to have died close to that time .
it has been described about an amun church of thibis in the gravestone article .
if that is the case , this philosophy should be of a different member of the royal family such as meritaten .
the reason for that is connecting with ( ' wa - n rayge riya / neferkapeparure ' ) them .
when it is connected to nefarnefruatan , its prior name ' wa en rege p riya ' which depicts a relation to acnatans .
it should be a few years after stopping the building of the cemetery .
also he states that she is the queen of dukhamunsu who had relatiins with the hitait people .
also , there are no ' short names with the name ' neferenerafrojatton ' .
later , during the reign of king horemheb , whole amarna era was disgusted .
also , when working for her husband , she did not have the desire to take pharaoh 's name who generally has a dual career .
also the death date of the cemetery owner could not confirmed and if he served the new king or not .
he and meritatan who is holding the position the great royal wife is preparing to present a gift to the owner of the mausoleum .
according to that there are almost no facts about king tutankhamun of the city of amarna .
accordingly , he took the ruling power into his hands and changed his name as ankhkheperur<unk> -neferneferuaten .
thereby nefernefruartan must have acquired the thrine after him .
by that time , aknatan tried to become father to his grandchildren
eden dodsaon 's amarna sanset book is considered as the most latest hypothesis on chronology and order of incident .
eventhough mostly they were in the form of ... " ge p riya , " sometimes it can be seen as " active towards her husband . "
on either side of them there were four empty cartouches with enough space to put the names of two kings .
his findings have been confirmed later on by james allen
after his death , she gains full pharaoh 's authority and governs the kingdom in the name of the king nerhenavehruththan .
he states that although the kings called akhnaten , neferneferuaten and smenkkare were amarnabhi kings , only a few rings exist as facts on tutankaten .
he pointed out the name ' ankhkheperure ' was rendered differently depending on whether it was associated with smenkhkare or neferneferuaten
he suggests that the reason for meritaten 's downfall from his position was political incapability .
in his book " history of egypt " he has listed all the kings according to their royal family .
he took over her thorone name along with the name smenkhkare
by means of cut markers , it demonstrates the beginning of the works of the place chosen to bury her coffin .
however , the dates of the sight of mary 's cemetery are not mentioned , and there is no reference to akknaatan .
goblandy says that according to the smekkarake wine chart , it appears that smekkarake has come to the throne after akknathan .
it is evident that she held the post succeeding nefertiti as the name of akhenaten is mentioned with the name of meritaten as the main queen in the tomb of tutankhamun
an inscription on priests found in the mausoleum :
since tutankhamun was still living , and because he is from the royal lineage , the queen meritaten queen may have prevented his succession .
dodson concludes that nefertity is the mother of tutankhatan .
dodson writes thus : ... " the next arguementative subject would clearly be about her origin .
dodson suspects that tutankhamen 's years of reign were used in name , even though she bore the leadership .
others still believe that smenkhkare and neferneferuaten are the same person .
a priest lived during the ages of tolomees in third century .
the whole set of information about the relationship of dakamunsu / sanansa is received through hitayit sources which were written few years after the incident
but maybe she was downgraded from the royal position to the position of the king 's wife as she was unsuccessful in ruling the state .
but what allan believes is that when considering these title names and their external forms , simply these children were ' fake ' names used to fill the space there .
but with the findings of scarab images and the rings containing his name , it can be understood that the city was populated during his reign as well .
but that object could have belonged to one of these two men .
but these images are often suggested to be smennaker and meritant , since those images are not similar to the tauterman 's and his queen 's images .
but they also have ideas that they belonged to akkanton and nefferti .
but recently it has been suggested that wine will be produced in his garden during his follower 's first year .
this theory continues to be an assumption as there are no dated facts on enemy or con-current kings .
but in the present his book is not existing and , there are remnants of occasions where other writers copied the parts of his book .
but the opinion of smennechkar 's reign is still debated .
even though there was a joint administration in the new kingdom , mr monnets ideas about the absence of dual day was written like this .
or , since tutankhamun had been succeeded to her throne , his officers would have buried her with a funeral kit of another king .
rewis sees this as an important part to solve the nefertiti problem .
the successor of the neferneferuaten , many of her information has been deleted from the history .
it can be seen that nefarnefruatan 's predecessor has refused to give her the burrial of a king .
allen later showed that neferneferuaten 's enemies can be divided in to three groups .
there is a female called neferneferuaten and here are the factors which describe her gender & identity .
it can be seen that the idea of neferneferuaten being meritatan is very uncertain .
marc gabolde strongly believes that king neferneferuaten and meritaten are the same person .
nefartiti was a name proposed for king nefarnefruatan during the early days .
in the later year notes , it only mentions about a queen .
later , mark gabold who is a french egyptologist mentioned that a few items found in tutankhamen 's tomb were initially created for neferneferuaten .
it is believed that she ruled on her own because of the descriptions of her reign in the epigraph of pyiri .
a shocking point that is optic and - leaders mortuary is started within the churchyard .
since he did not have a male heir , ecnatan later had ancessenphat as his wife
although there is a idea about a joint ruling occurs due to the bowl , it could be an attempt of a king to connect his name to the name of his predecessor .
most egyptians admit that she is a woman and she is another smenchaker 's king .
in several of his papers and at least one book ( written in french ) , mark gabold states that she is meritatan .
mark gabold states that tutankhaten did not reign over amarnahi for more than a few months .
from this it can be seen that during the final period of her reign , the ban on amun worship was removed and traditional religion was restored once more .
according to miller , they are " written with perfect understanding about the sad realities of this methodology .
miller states that the word " servant " must have been used as a derogatory term and not literally .
earlier it was reported about a clump of stone that included almost complete line diagrams of the names of smenkhare king and his royal wife great meritatan .
it has been reinforced officially after the recent harassment .
a similar situation can be found in the text related to hatshepsut in penyati 's tomb .
without the grand children the age of her cannot be proved with evidence .
one can say that by altering the history to some extent , marsuli is trying to transfer the whole responsibility of this deceit .
in this period , there are no instances where a long name is followed by the name ' smennaker ' .
although this assumption acknowledges some of the facts to be true , it has been proven that the argument nefertiti to be the mother of thutthrakhthan is wrong .
this gives evidence of his short rule as a king .
according to these information it seems that nefarnefaruā<unk> an was overthrown during the power struggle .
the part of the emblem clearly recognizes the " d<unk> azzer " and " kerapur " letters and the symbol of the " ka "

the ultimate benefit is the claims and claims for compensation , the material usability of the insurance .
insurance funds - this is an insurance cover given together by the government and banks .
in fact , some policyholders have won when comparing to the insurer 's .
it has been ordered by law that an insurance is mandatory to drive a vehicle in a road in the united states .
the government has provided the national flood protection program with the provision of this insurance cover to certain parts of the united states .
from the home insurance in america there is a small health protection for the owner , equipment and persons which will be harmed when inside the home .
in america the standard type insurance companies mainly insure the essential properties .
the regulations that affect insurance companies in america differ from state to state .
those who are purchasing e and o insurance are real estate traders , house observers , and valuers and website developers .
the reason is that they are issued by insurance companies and are governed according to an insurance policy .
not helping another person paves the way for the losing of help when you need help .
as an example a torched house was rebuilt with the help of everyone .
for example the insurance of a house owner covers instances where one is wounded due to slippling and falling in his premises and it is generally covered by the insurance .
for example , the insurance company seeks a high installment from older men because they can be at higher risk than young people .
for example , a company can obtain the burglary insurance coverage to cover the risk of losing money from theft or burglary .
one thing is when taking legal proceedings , for legal protection , if a payment is required to be paid according to the court order , it will also be paid .
one insurance policy can cover multiple risks .
in a way insurance can be defined as something which started simultaneously with the mankind .
the losses incurred by natural disasters in the united states are interesting .
increase in profits and healthy economic environments have caused the growth .
the same policy is applied for every person for insurance schemes such as housing , vehicle and business premises .
dealers who transport goods by sea should pay a certain percentage of value of the goods .
that means the traders promised to pay more when the money is loaned and the loaner promised to cancel the loan if the goods were robbed .
because of economic growth , control of inflation and growth in the stock market , the life insurance and general insurance both grew .
this is a essential by-result of insurance policy in evaluating the " risk in change " and in assessing insurance premiums .
under the same condition , when paying for another person , the homeowner does not suffer losses when the insurance company pays the homeowner according to the request made .
therefore , the same principle and the investment management entrepreneurial insurance are also applied here .
also , these insurances provide facilities that general insurances do not provide at an affordable price .
the reason was that they did not want interest and application forms .
the reason is that the life insurance is a long term investment and other insurance schemes such as properties are limited to a period .
there are also instances where it is seen as a changed treatment of illegality .
it provides a monthly relief in fulfilling responsibilities related to mortgaging and credit cards .
even though it is important in writing , in kiriāna there is no much of a difference .
it covers medical expenses in foreign countries , loss of goods , delays in journeys , personal loans .
it has evolved that it is different from properties and phenomena .
several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual .
simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book , origins of genius : darwinian perspectives on creativity .
students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating , valued for its own sake .
teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity .
the aspect of motivation within a person 's personality may predict creativity levels in the person .
the cattell - horn - carroll theory includes creativity as a subset of intelligence .

the idea must also be appropriate - useful and actionable .
their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard - work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination .
the iterative ( and possibly bidirectional ) processing .
the lexeme in the english word creativity comes from the latin term cre<unk> " to create , make " : its derivational suffixes also come from latin .
the neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour .
there has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs .
there was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives .
these are referred to as the four " creativity profiles " that can help achieve such goals .
these are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark .
these cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed hierarchical modular selection and identification for control ( hmosaic ) .
these new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes .
these tests were untimed , and given in a game - like manner ( aiming to facilitate creativity ) .
the use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees .
this article also explored the links between creativity and sleep , mood and addiction disorders , and depression .
this possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct , but intersecting constructs .
this study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres , allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate .
threshold theory - intelligence is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for creativity .
together , these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity .
to get into the amusement park , there are initial requirements ( e .
to promote creative thinking , educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it .
tt posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity .
under this view , creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs , but they do overlap under the correct conditions .
unusual uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks .
wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process , which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments .
when compared to human raters , nlp techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality ( when compared to human raters ) .
about one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi - arid .
a sand sheet is a near - level , firm expanse of partially consolidated particles in a layer that varies from a few centimeters to a few meters thick .
a semi - arid desert or a steppe is a version of the arid desert with much more rainfall , vegetation and higher humidity .
as the desert mountains decay , large areas of shattered rock and rubble occur .
as the mountains are eroded , more and more sand is created .
as this wind - induced movement of sand grains takes place , the dune moves slowly across the surface of the ground .
at high wind speeds , sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along , a process known as saltation .
being ectotherms , reptiles are unable to live in cold deserts but are well - suited to hot ones .
berbers with knowledge of the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells .
both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands .
cacti are present in both north and south america with a post - gondwana origin .
cold deserts , sometimes known as temperate deserts , occur at higher latitudes than hot deserts , and the aridity is caused by the dryness of the air .
david faiman has proposed that " giant " solar plants in the negev could supply all of israel 's needs for electricity .
desertification is caused by such factors as drought , climatic shifts , tillage for agriculture , overgrazing and deforestation .
deserts , both hot and cold , play a part in moderating the earth 's temperature .
deserts of this type are often long and narrow and bounded to the east by mountain ranges .
deserts play a significant role in human culture with an extensive literature .
deserts usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range , with high daytime temperatures falling sharply at night .
dunes are sometimes solitary , but they are more often grouped together in dune fields .
during a sandstorm , the wind - blown sand particles become electrically charged .
dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites , limestone and sandstone .
eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes .
european interest in the sahara desert stems from its two aspects : the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land .
evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants .
former desert areas presently in non - arid environments , such as the sandhills in nebraska , are known as paleodeserts .
for these reasons , the front line moved back and forth through hundreds of kilometers as each side lost and regained momentum .
humans have long made use of deserts as places to live , and more recently have started to exploit them for minerals and energy capture .
in common with cacti , many have developed spines to ward off browsing animals .
in fact , with a very few exceptions , their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size , irrespective of the climate in which they live .
in many environments , the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover .
in other words , about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain .
in some parts of the world , deserts are created by a rain shadow effect .
in the first part of the night , as the ground radiates the heat absorbed during the day , they emerge and search for prey .
in the first world war , the ottoman turks were engaged with the british regular army in a campaign that spanned the arabian peninsula .
in the köppen climate classification system , deserts are classed as bwh ( hot desert ) or bwk ( temperate desert ) .
in the occurrence of precipitation , its intensity and distribution ; and low humidity .
in the process they cool and lose much of their moisture by precipitation on the windward slope of the mountain range .
in the second world war , the western desert campaign began in italian libya .
is complex and dynamic , varying by culture , era , and technologies ; thus the use of the word desert can cause confusion .
it can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required , but during the day , many deserts become very hot .
lakes may form in basins where there is sufficient precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above .
large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors , including nine fields of solar collectors .
many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day .
many centuries later , both world wars saw fighting in the desert .
many desert plants have reduced the size of their leaves or abandoned them altogether .
many desert reptiles are ambush predators and often bury themselves in the sand , waiting for prey to come within range .
many successful solar power plants have been built in the mojave desert .
mars is the only planet in the solar system on which deserts have been identified .
nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life .
oil and gas form on the bottom of shallow seas when micro - organisms decompose under anoxic conditions and later become covered with sediment .
one well - studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert - inhabiting species .
orographic lift occurs as air masses rise to pass over high ground .
other regions of the world have cold deserts , including areas of the himalayas and other high - altitude areas in other parts of the world .
others occur on the eastern side of the rocky mountains , the eastern side of the southern andes and in southern australia .
others store water in succulent leaves or stems or in fleshy tubers .
other xerophytic plants have developed similar strategies by a process known as convergent evolution .
people have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi - arid lands for millennia .
plants face severe challenges in arid environments .
polar deserts ( also seen as " cold deserts " ) have similar features , except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain .
polar deserts cover much of the ice - free areas of the arctic and antarctic .
polar deserts such as mcmurdo dry valleys remain ice - free because of the dry katabatic winds that flow downhill from the surrounding mountains .
potential evapotranspiration , then , is the amount of water that could evaporate in any given region .
problems they need to solve include how to obtain enough water , how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce .
rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process .
reptiles cannot survive at this temperature and lizards will be prostrated by heat at .
rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes , found on the upwind edges of sand seas .
saguaro grow slowly but may live for up to two hundred years .
sandstorms occur with much less frequency than dust storms .
some major oilfields such as ghawar are found under the sands of saudi arabia .
star dunes are formed by variable winds , and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point .
the cultivation of semi - arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification .
the distance between their crests corresponds to the average length of jumps made by particles during saltation .
the electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground .
the giant saguaro cacti of the sonoran desert form " forests , " providing shade for other plants and nesting places for desert birds .
the hohokam tribe constructed over of large canals and maintained them for centuries , an impressive feat of engineering .
their self - sufficient skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth .
their weight prevents them from being airborne for long and most only travel a distance of a few meters ( yards ) .
the lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation .
the largest of these deserts are found in central asia .
the negev desert , israel , and the surrounding area , including the arava valley , receive plenty of sunshine and are generally not arable .
the potential for generating solar energy from the sahara desert is huge , the highest found on the globe .
the process continues and the end products are either dust or sand .
the sahara is a very large expanse of land stretching from the atlantic rim to egypt .
the sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of europe .
the saltbush in australia has succulent leaves and secretes salt crystals , enabling it to live in saline areas .
these also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction .
these include the great salt lake , utah lake , sevier lake and many dry lake beds .
these regions feature a semi - arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts .
the shape of the dune depends on the characteristics of the prevailing wind .
the smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the martian polar regions .
the surface of the trunk is folded like a concertina , allowing it to expand , and a large specimen can hold eight tons of water after a good downpour .
the tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves , ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards .
they are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea .
they are often preceded by severe dust storms and occur when the wind velocity increases to a point where it can lift heavier particles .
they are usually shallow and saline , and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress , moving the water over nearby low - lying areas .
they form downwind of copious sources of dry , loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle .
they have few adaptations to desert life and are unable to cool themselves by sweating so they shelter during the heat of the day .
they limit water loss by reducing the size and number of stomata , by having waxy coatings and hairy or tiny leaves .
they occur in namibia , chile , southern california and baja california .
they share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas .
they then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy .
they travelled over large areas with their herds , moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth .
this area of deposited clay , silt or sand is known as a playa .
this is because they reflect more of the incoming light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea .
this may have happened when drought caused the death of herd animals , forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation .
when the lakes dry up , they leave a crust or hardpan behind .
when they descend on the leeward side , they warm and their capacity to hold moisture increases so an area with relatively little precipitation occurs .
when they reach the crest , they cascade down the far side .
where sand does occur , it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes .
with few inputs , they were at the mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level .
aau competes on the one , three , and tower to determine the all - american team .
additionally , some dives can be started in a flying position .
adult divers who are not competitive at an elite level may compete in masters diving .
a greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute maneuvers .
all of these dives come with dd ( degree of difficulty ) this is an indication of how difficult / complex a dive is .
almost invariably , at national level , diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports .
an alternative explanation is that the moving arms have precession torque on them which set the body into twisting rotation .
an armstand dive may have a higher degree of difficulty outdoors compared to indoors as wind can destabilize the equilibrium of the diver .
a number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills .
as the diver leaves the board , the total angular momentum vector is horizontal , pointing directly to the left for a forward dive for example .
attempting to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation is extremely inadvisable as it can cause serious back injuries .
at the moment of take - off , two critical aspects of the dive are determined , and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution .
because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a lifeguard is not on duty .
besides the obvious instances of setting records , absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets .
champions from each of these events have gone on to compete at the collegiate and olympic levels .
coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport .
college divers interested in tower diving may compete in the ncaa separate from swim team events .
competitive athletes are divided by gender , and often by age group .
consequently , divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements .
despite the apparent risk , the statistical incidence of injury in supervised training and competition is extremely low .
difficulty is rated according to the degree of difficulty of the dives .
divers often feel , for example , that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities .
divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical , especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements .
divers who continue diving past their college years can compete in master s ' diving programs .
dives with multiple twists and somersaults are some of the most spectacular movements , as well as the most challenging to perform .
diving from the higher levels increases the danger and likelihood of such injuries .
diving is also popular as a non - competitive activity .
diving is an internationally recognized sport that is part of the olympic games .
diving is a separate sport in olympic and club diving .
diving is one of the most popular olympic sports with spectators .
diving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard , usually while performing acrobatics .
each dive is assigned a degree of difficulty ( dd ) , which is determined from a combination of the moves undertaken , position used , and height .
each division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition .
entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity , as is underwater swimming .
entry to the water is invariably feet - first to avoid the risk of injury that would be involved in head - first entry from that height .
for a five - judge panel , the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the dd .
for example , they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on .
free - indicates a twisting dive , and a combination of other positions .
group d divers have only recently been allowed to compete on the tower .
high school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition .
however , man - made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations .
however , some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms .
in competition , the dives are referred to by a schematic system of three - or four - digit numbers .
in serious meets , the absolute score is somewhat meaningless .
in the olympics or other highly competitive meets , many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors .
in the past , the age group could compete only springboard , to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving .
in the republic of ireland facilities are limited to one pool at the national aquatic centre in dublin .
in the summer usa diving sanctions the summer nationals including all three events with both junior and senior divers .
in the transition between two positions the diver may for example bend their legs or curve at the waist , and points will not be deducted for doing so .
in the united kingdom , diving competitions on all boards run throughout the year .
in the united states scholastic diving at the college level requires one and three meter diving .
in the united states scholastic diving at the high school level is usually limited to one meter diving .
in the united states scholastic diving is almost always part of the school 's swim team .
in the united states , summer diving is usually limited to one meter diving at community or country club pools .
it is the relative score , not the absolute score that wins meets .
it was at this event that the swedish tradition of fancy diving was introduced to the sport by the athletes otto hagborg and c f mauritzi .
jo divers compete in age groups at inter - club competitions , at invitationals , and if qualified , at regional , zone and national competitions .
many accidents also occur when divers do not account for rocks and logs in the water .
many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet .
master s ' diving programs are frequently offered by college or club programs .
most divers have pre - dive and post - dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus .
national championships take place late in the year , usually during november .
once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum .
one is the trajectory of the dive , and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum .
outdoor diving typically takes place from cliffs or other rock formations either into fresh or salt water .
scores from the one and three meter competition contribute to the swim team 's overall meet score .
scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team 's overall score .
since the tucked shape is the most compact , it gives the most control over rotational speed , and dives in this position are easier to perform .
the ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill , and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training .
the body is kept straight with the arms extended to the side , and the regular dive position is assumed at about half the dive .
the competitive diver will attempt the highest dd dives possible with which they can achieve consistent , high scores .
the dd value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges .
the diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water .
the eleven dives are usually split up between two categories : five required dives and six optional dives .
the exact origins of the sport are unclear , though it likely derives from the act of diving at the start of swimming races .
the execution judges are positioned two on each side of the pool , and they score the diver which is nearer to them .
the first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive .
the first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above .
the global governing body of diving is fina , which also governs swimming , synchronised swimming , water polo and open water swimming .
the importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the dd , but how they arrange their list .
the latter applies only to platform competitions , whereas the other five apply to both springboard and platform .
the limit is four years , but could be less under certain circumstances .
the ncaa limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions .
the ncaa will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed .
the opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation , but merely slows it down .
the raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor , derived from the number and combination of movements attempted .
there are six " groups " into which dives are classified : forward , back , inward , reverse , twist , and armstand .
there are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations , but they are rarely successful .
there is a general misconception about scoring and judging .
the result is that the emphasis is on the synchronization of the divers .
the rules state that the body should be vertical , or nearly so , for entry .
the score that the dive receives is multiplied by the dd ( also known as tariff ) to give the dive a final score .
these are currently the fina recommended minimum depths .
these competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school - age children .
these scholarships are usually offered to divers with age - group or club diving experience .
the soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height .
the third digit represents the number of half - somersaults .
the tilting is done by the arms , which are outstretched to the sides just before the twist .
the total is then weighted by and multiplied by the dd .
they also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive .
this applies especially in cases where the wrong dive is announced .
this change was implemented because new dives were being invented too frequently for an annual meeting to accommodate the progress of the sport .
this is very painful and distressing , but not life - threatening .
this tradition evolved into ' fancy diving ' , while diving as a preliminary to swimming became known as ' plain diving ' .
to win dive meets , divers create a dive list in advance of the meet .
to win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers .
usually a score considers three elements of the dive : the approach , the flight , and the entry .
a braun tube ( a crt ) was used for displaying the range .
a digital computer with considerable capability ( new at that time ) was necessary for analyzing the data .
a key development was the magnetron in the uk , which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub - meter resolution .
all of the work was under the utmost secrecy ; it could not even be discussed with other scientists and engineers at portsmouth .
also , for a given pulse repetition frequency ( prf ) , a shorter pulse results in a higher peak power .
also , with the antennas aimed at a low angle , there was a dead zone of some distance caused by interference from ground - level reflections .
although many of bowen 's transmitter and receiver components were used , the system would not be airborne so there were no limitations on antenna size .
although originally intended to be temporary until better systems were available , they remained in operation throughout the war .
among other activities , the scl was made responsible for research in the detection of aircraft by acoustical and infrared radiation means .
a radar gun does not return information regarding the object 's position ; it uses the doppler effect to measure the speed of a target .
as each pulse is emitted , it is radiated over a lateral band onto the terrain .
a second truck carrying the electrical generator and other equipment was backed against the transmitter truck .
a similar system was developed by satake for the japanese homeland .

based on success of the sea trials , the nrl further improved the system .
based on the previous investigations , the scl first tried microwaves .
based on this , page , taylor , and young are usually credited with building and demonstrating the world 's first true radar .
because of us - ussr abm agreements , this was abandoned within two years .
before the end of the decade this had resulted in publications with worldwide distribution , such as the german journal annalen der physik .
both receiving and the transmitting antennas used large arrays of dipole wires on wooden frames .
by timing the pulses on an oscilloscope , the range could be determined and the direction of the antenna revealed the angular location of the targets .
commander chuji hashimoto of the ntri was responsible for initiating this activity .
commonly called the " tizard committee " after its chairman , sir henry tizard , this group had a profound influence on technical developments in britain .
current ultra - wideband systems have resolutions of a few millimeters .
during bad weather or fog , the device would be periodically spun to check for nearby ships .
during the cold war period following wwii , the primary " axis " of combat shifted to lie between the united states and the soviet union .
engineers from western electric and westinghouse were brought in to assist in the overall development .
even before the end of the war , various project directed toward non - military applications of radar and closely related technologies were initiated .
far more than the atomic bomb , radar contributed to the allied victory in world war ii .
for a long time , the japanese had believed that they had the best fighting capability of any military force in the world .
for further research in detection methods , a major conference on this subject was arranged for the pvo by the russian academy of sciences .
for greater directional accuracy , lobe switching on the receiving antennas was adopted .
for testing the concept , korovin arranged the transmitting and receiving antennas along the flight path of an aircraft .
from the start , the firm was always called simply gema .
hans hollmann and theodor schultes , both affiliated with the prestigious heinrich hertz institute in berlin , were added as consultants .
he concluded that the desired accuracy in measuring distance to targets could be attained only by using pulsed electromagnetic waves .
he patented the device , called the telemobiloscope , but due to lack of interest by the naval authorities the invention was not put into production .
he proposed using a directional receiver based on watt 's lightning detection concept , listening for powerful signals from a separate transmitter .
here the equipment would be openly operated in the guise of an ionospheric monitoring station .
his device consisted of a simple spark gap used to generate a signal that was aimed using a dipole antenna with a cylindrical parabolic reflector .
his radar telescope was taken away by the conquering soviet army and had to be rebuilt , thus delaying the experiment .
historically , this marked the first naval vessel equipped with radar .
historically , warships in formation used lights and horns to avoid collision at night or when in fog .
hollmann built a regenerative receiver and schultes developed yagi antennas for transmitting and receiving .
hull at general electric , and yagi was convinced that it could function in the vhf or even the uhf region .
hülsmeyer also received a patent amendment for estimating the range to the ship .
hyland working with taylor and young , now at the u.s. naval research laboratory ( nrl ) in washington , d .
in addition to the work on ch and successor systems , there was now major work in airborne rdf equipment .
increases in signal processing capability due to the introduction of solid state computers has also had a large impact on radar use .
in fact , essentially all major radar astronomy activities have been conducted as adjuncts to radio astronomy observatories .
in fact , runge was already experimenting with high - frequency transmitters and had telefunken 's tube department working on cm - wavelength devices .
in his report , popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects , but he did nothing more with this observation .
in initial systems , the signal processing was too complex for on - board operation ; the signals were recorded and processed later .
in the united states , both the navy and army needed means of remotely locating enemy ships and aircraft .
ioffe was generally considered the top russian physicist of his time .
it did not provide range ( distance ) information , only warning of a nearby object .
it had a number of parasitic elements and would come to be known as the yagi - uda or yagi antenna .
it not only had competent engineers and physicists on its central staff , but also had a number of scientific research institutes .
it was , however , the first microwave radio - detection system .
it was not until after the start of war that the imperial army had equipment that could be called radar .
kühnhold remained with the nva , but also consulted with gema .
moore was assigned to head the complex electrical and mechanical design of lobe switching antennas .
motion of the vehicle along the flight path gives the horizontal increments .
nec assigned kinji satake of their research institute to develop a system called the bi - static doppler interference detector .
neither side even mentioned magnetrons , but the germans did apparently disclose their use of pulsed techniques .
no attempts were made to make this into a pulsed system , thus , it could not provide range and was not qualified to be classified as a radar .
nssl 's research helped convince the national weather service that doppler radar was a crucial forecasting tool .
numerous similar systems , which provided directional information to objects over short ranges , were developed over the next two decades .
on the one hand , radar contributed very little to theory , which was largely known since the days of maxwell and hertz .
over the following three decades in germany , a number of radio - based detection systems were developed but none were true radars .
primary credit for introducing beamed rdf systems in britain must be given to butement .
radio astronomy also had its start following wwii , and many scientists involved in radar development then entered this field .
radio engineering was strong in japan 's higher education institutions , especially the imperial universities .
reflection of radio signals was critical to the proposed technique , and the air ministry asked if this could be proven .
robert buderi states that it was also the precursor of much modern technology .
robert morris page was assigned by taylor to implement young 's suggestion .
sar has wide applications , particularly in mapping and remote sensing .
separate receivers and antennas were used for azimuth and elevation detection .
six wooden towers were erected , two for stringing the transmitting antenna , and four for corners of crossed receiving antennas .
some use infrared radiation or laser light ; these are usually called lidar .
stepp also code - named the system darmstadt after his home town , starting the practice in telefunken of giving the systems names of cities .
systems using an alternate technology have also been developed for over - the - horizon detection .
that had to await the invention of pulsed radar , and later , additional encoding techniques to extract this information from a cw signal .
the academic research tended toward the improvement of basic technologies , rather than their specific applications .
the air ministry also adopted this system as a mobile auxiliary to the ch system .
the antennas for both systems rotate atop a tall tower .
the cavity magnetron was also of interest to yagi .
the early meteorologists had to watch a cathode ray tube .
the equipment was first tested at a nva site at the lübecker bay near pelzerhaken .
the equipment was temporarily installed on the uss leary , with a yagi antenna mounted on a gun barrel for sweeping the field of view .
the equipment was used in an attempt to detect reflections from tall structures a few kilometers away .
the experiments with pulsed radar were continued , primarily in improving the receiver for handling the short pulses .
the first apparatus used a split - anode magnetron purchased from philips in the netherlands .

there was an early interest in equipment for radio direction - finding , for use in both navigation and military surveillance .
there was still no commitment by top japanese naval officials for using this technology aboard warships .
there were often impediments , however , in transferring these advancements into the military .
the scl called this technique radio position - finding ( rpf ) .
these were the first vessels in the royal navy with rdf systems .
the short wavelength and high power made it very effective at spotting submarines from the air .
the system was still incapable of directly determining the range .
this experiment gave poor results , attributed to the very low power from the magnetron .
this included all of the then - existing information on radio - location in the ussr , available to researchers in this field throughout the world .
this included undergraduate and graduate study , as well as academic research in this field .
this is in contrast to the later development of pulsed radar , which determines distance via two - way transit time of the pulse .
this is possible because impulse radar can concisely locate the boundaries between the general media ( the soil ) and the desired target .
this led to a proposal and patent for using this technique for detecting ships and aircraft .
this testing was in part to show the nkkf ( soviet navy ) the value of early - warning radio - location for protecting strategic ports .
this truck - mounted system was designed as a small version of a ch station .
this would also allow the direct determination of range to the target .
through the years , many variations of the sar have been made with diversified applications resulting .
to distinguish targets from other reflections , it was necessary to use a phase - doppler system .
to distribute the conference findings to a wider audience , the proceedings were published the following month in a journal .
to provide early warning of an attack , both deployed huge radar networks of increasing sophistication at ever - more remote locations .
to test this , wilkins set up receiving equipment in a field near upper stowe , northamptonshire .
to this day , this is the most widely used directional antenna worldwide .
tsuneo ito also joined the ntri and continued his research on magnetrons in association with yoji ito .
tuve at the carnegie institution of washington for successfully measuring the height of the ionosphere .
unlike the high - power magnetron in britain , however , the initial device from the ntri generated only a few hundred watts .
using wwii technology based on vacuum tubes , it gave only coarse reflectivity data and no velocity information .
watson became the scl chief engineer and led the project .
when a signal reflected from a ship was picked up by a similar antenna attached to the separate coherer receiver , a bell sounded .
wide - scale deployment is expected by the end of the decade in some countries such as the united states , france , and canada .
wilhelm stepp developed a transmit - receive device ( a duplexer ) for allowing a common antenna .
with the advent of satellites with early - warning capabilities , the military lost most of its interest in oth radars .
with this , radar activities in germany and japan ceased for a number of years .

six people died while the ship was being built , and another was killed when it was about to launch by a beam falling on to the head .
if the ship was filled with all the passengers it could carry this quantity of boats available would be sufficient for only one third .
some bodies that drowned with the ship couldn 't collect at all , since they were everywhere .
the system consisted of all-round pipes , taps and valves throughout the ship .
less than one third of the people who were in the shipwreck were saved .
staff of the ship had been divided into three groups .
the ship 's exposed decks were covered with pine and teak wood , and the ceilings were made of cork wood .
four out of five people of the ship 's crew came from this city .
the lowest window of the ship was also located on this deck .
later , reports confirming the sinking of the titanic ship with its large number of passengers were obtained .
for almost twelve hours , the ship was being tested at various speeds , taking quick turns and turning off completely .
during the trials different characteristics of the ship was tested and tests were first carried out at belfast lagoon , and then sent to the irish sea .
the first class included a swimming pool , a gym , a squash court , and a special bathing facility which is called " turkish bath . "
common areas of first class were done beautifully in wood and consisted of expensive furniture .
the first class majestic entrance to the staircase and the gymnasium were in the middle of the ship with the roof of the first-class lounge .
the first class and second class passengers were personally welcomed by the captain and the stewards directed them to their rooms .

these change 's effects of the weight of the titanic , and she was fortunate enough to be the largest ship ever sailed on the sea .
every one of these engines contributed towards rotating a fantail of the ship .
many books , movies , songs , sports , etc. were released based on this incident .
after taking out the ship from the dock it was then taken out to another dock to repair engine , smoke chambers , and interiors .
thousands of books released on that , movies , productions , some helped to remember that .

arahant as a lay person does not live in a layman 's life .
arahath monks are ones who achieve nirvana by understanding the buddha dharma .
the last : focusing on the study by aryan eight fold and not focusing on other studies .
he says that the asoka pillars depicting the mission of the dhamma in india shows the indian influence .
there is a contemplation of the information about the religion in each of the two books of the sutta and the vinaya
the noble eightfold path teaches how to weaken and totally eradicate the defilement .
the duty of the laymen is to prevent the male / female monks from suffering due to lack of food , clothing , temples and medicine .
monks do not decide a time period for walking or sitting meditation .
there is little information about india 's later theravada buddhism
then , an internal exploration , analysis , experience and understanding of the true nature of the secretions is obtained through the knowledge .
the importance given to it in theravada is less important than the position given in mahayana and the vajrayana .
his parents also receive merit rewards as they enter to " upasampada . "
it 's not just about ethics and a set of policies .
if its said plainly its lord buddha that turned the cycle of dhamma .
that is the existence - the desire for nothing and the great desire for self - defense .
the desire for survival can be displayed in many different ways .
this was the first time that it was given not only to the west but also to the east .
you can get rid of birth , sickness , old age and death from it .
another group of westerners were able to print the pali sutta library for truth and later add it to the internet .
then the mind can be used to investigate the truth of the reality .
or by exploring the direct experience of truth , it is possible to find happiness in pursuing the noble eightfold path of knowledge that was taught by the lord buddha
as well as theravada followers believe that the people without the understanding of the dhamma are living loyal to their bodies thinking that it is their own and holding it .
but the traditions followed within a monastery are of a different nature .
but , it is not a rare thing to hold ordination in periods longer & shorter than that .
but boys below that age can be added newly for the ordination .
but these two parts act as religious teachers in their own society .
but these three categorizations have not been recognized by all academics .
therefore what a person should do is make his own mind out of relationships .
hence , the suffering is created first by ourselves .
it shows that even though there are differences between them a combination is also formed from them one by one .
vision , sound , touch , taste , odor and mental concepts were included in them .
it is a reserve collected by those who practiced the teachings of this tradition .
they are written in relation to old documents written in old sinhala .
they are three types : sil or the discipline , samadi or the mental training and praghgaa or the development of knowledge .
they treat a wedding of a man who was previously a bikkhu that enters his marriage maturedly with a sense of " well ripened . "
they can not get out of the cycle of recurrence , that is , birth , disease , aging , and death .
as they travel a long way , they walk barefooted to a place where they feel in their heart .
he insists that all three of these ideas are contained in the pali thripitakaya
according to his explanation followers of theravada must have added parts to tripitaka even back then .
even becoming a monk for a shorter string can be considered as a life full of values and qualities .
however , observing the documents of the theravada tradition is important .
however these notes do not get the important position held by the thripitaka .
those who are defrauded by defilements are those without knowledge of dharma .
in activities done by lay people there was no place to follow pali , thripitaka or buddhist meditation techniques
one of the responsibilities of a layman is to fulfill the requirements of a monk and the monks as said by buddha .
it is traditionally accepted that the duty of the layman is chiefly to share good deeds .
in the state of knowledge , the sensory doors that are physical become blurred .
it is about , you should take the responsibility for your deeds , in pali it 's called " karma " and in the cultural language it 's called " kamma . "
the theravada is the first of buddhist to take up the step to write the complete thripitakaya .
young men in thailand and burma obtain ordination during the three month period called as spring
there are people who know the basic teachings of buddhism though they don 't have a vast knowledge about tri-pitaka .
theravada is followed in south eastern countries such as cambodia , laos , burma and thailand .
a basic fact about theravada is that it is an analysis of life and beyond .
in theravada , the arhats attending nirvana are regarded as liberated in the same way as the lord buddha .
according to theravada the reason for all person 's suffering is the greed .
people all over the world from different countries follow theravada buddhism
nirvana , the highest goal of theravada buddhism , can be achieved through the study of virtue and its use in everyday life .
theravada has become popular in the western world in recent decades .
in beliefs of theravada , the buddhas or gods or other sacred persons can not give an awakening to the human .
it is believed that the pali canon that is used by the theravada , is brought to sri lanka during the time of the emperor asoka .
according to the followers of theravada the buddha is an extraordinary human being .
for theravadins buddha is , only the teacher of the noble eightfold path .
by following the theravadi procedures it gives the opportunity to reach four paths of fruition which lead to liberation .
people who believe gods and others as sacred are who experience anger , jealousy , hatred , revenge , desire , greed , delusion and death .
the tradition of the wilderness is targeted over the tradition of following religion in order to gain the supernatural powers of conventional folklore .
theravada buddhists believe that people who lack understanding of dhamma , experience the world with their six senses ( eyes , ears , nose , tongue , feel and mind )
people who cannot identify the religion is holdings sins with them because they cannot understand the truth .
the road to nirvana , or the noble eightfold path , is sometimes referred to as the three noble disciplines .
it was generally considered that reaching the goal of nibbana can be done successfully by ordained monks living in monasteries .
if someone attains the state of nibbana , it would be as an arhat .
with the aim of not finding nibbana even a layman can take it as a happiness to his life .
there are griefs for many who have a certain ability to understand that there is no definite indentation or that there is always a change in their identity .
it is said that buddhism has experienced a resurgence over the previous decades , not only in western countries , but also in its birth country of india .
in the first dhamma sangayana , according to most of the scholars , there was only two original copies .
non followers of theravada did not accept pali abhidamma .
the pali canon is the most respected book in the theravada tradition and takes the lead among the scriptures written by gautama buddha
with the translation and publication of pali canon , for the first time in history pali canon was handed to lay society .
the name of a male devotee in pali language is called " upasaka "
it is considered to be a disgrace to leave a life of ordination .
since the monks are not allowed to engage in a profession , they are surviving by the laity .
bhikku uppsitation is considered to be required at least 20 years of age from the date of connivance .
according to peter harvey , it contains ideas that are inconsistent with orthodox theravada views .
in the majority of the theravada countries , it is customary to remain in ordinance for a limited period of time .
lord buddha is superior to arahant bikkhus only because he understood the path to nirvana by himself and taught it to others .
burma and cambodia has stopped appointing a person for that position for a long time , but it was restarted .
the monasteries in burma and thailand are still considered to be places designated for education .
the bikkhus that meditate are mostly known as wild bikkhus , they are called as such because they maintain their meditation procedures in areas near forests .
as monk bodhi states , " the sutta and atta stories mention a few instances where laymen achieved the final goal of nirvana .
the thai women has the opinion that thai males who were bhikkhus before are more suitable marriage partners .
in the country where it was initiated there is no mention of the date it declined .
this is the distinct difference of india 's history of buddhism in relation to the other countries throughout the world .
according to this doctrine , an interdiscipline should arise through the searcher 's experience , critical exploration and criticism .
on this basis , both these sections of the tripitaka ( canon ) are considered to be the most ancient and most authoritative by buddhist scholars .
the one who follows this policy then will understand the true nature of that defilement and then to the understanding of four noble truths then open the path to understanding of the nibbahana .
this includes acts , such as the practice of the reincarnation of norms that began in a certain geographical area .
the ever changing nature ( of universe ) cause disappointment and grief .
defilements can be caused by hard , medium , or subtle levels .
we can see that when the theravada tradition had come to sri lanka , it had also gone to burma , and can see that some symbiosis has gradually developed .
at the end of the spring , many monks go into the most isolated areas ( often to the forests ) .
during every three months of the rainy season , a buddhist monk who engages in the daily course wakes up before sunrise .
the idea of the word insight is " vision " . " intuition " and so on .
the vibhajjavalians ' ideas were not the same as those of the old thera ideas , but they do have similarities .
although sri lanka 's sangha nikayas are organized according to the caste , men who enter the upasampala can temporarily leave the usual caste system .
the royal families of sri lanka and southeast asia has closely embraced buddhism .
here are three important characteristics of theravada philosophy that explain consecrations
literally " samatha " means " making skills . "
sometimes they will meditate in risky places or places where scary animals will live .
in some instances the abbot or the chief monk will hold the sermon for the guests who visited .
in some instances , forest people believe that the bone of a well-established monk will become crystals in their tradition .
some lay buddhists play an active role in religious activities .
some monks walk from evening to morning , while in some other occasions they walk between two and seven hours .
traditionally by simply observing the simple precepts such as the five precepts taught by buddha to the theravadans you can obtain simple results .
traditionally , temporary ordination is a much more flexible one in laos .
the one who defeated all carving living in a house is contradictory .
religions born of all initiations or reasons have no constant endurance , they change when the reasons behind them change , they are subjected to transformation .
sthavirawada or in other terms teachings of thera is still a continuing religion .
after the death of aknatan , she must have borne the post of samaraj yadikari / national captain for tutankatan .
since the names of the kings of amarna have been erased from history , the only ancient record containing information about this is the record of manatho .
her successors have used similar first names and she has not been given a royal burial .
her strategy succeeds and a hitait prince called sanansaa , will come to egypt and will marry her and claim ownership of the throne .
her primal clergy may have been in the service of her hostel church , located at thebes , the religious capital .
it is controversial that it was a co-governance of her state during which time it took control of it .
if they had added a new crown to her statue , it was a powerful testimony of the fact that nefarti had acquired a new name and post .
her age is not a barrier to that position , because tutankhan has also become a ruler at that age .
perhaps the authority of the ground was not in akhenaten 's hands at the time , but perhaps because it was in his mysterious co-ruler 's hand .
perhaps this would be a memorial chapel complex .
she succeeded him as an undefeatable empress in the name of ancpheruru .
she seems to have a rather gentle principle about the amun priest .
in her royal cemetery , it mentioned that she died during her childbirth .
after she was appointed to the throne after her husband 's death she used the royal name ankhekhepura .
it depends on her identity to indicate whether she ruled the kingdom before or after smennaker .
according to allen , if the female indicators are not taken into consideration , the above three names are known as the king of neferneferuatan .
alan suggests that she may have been a three year old at time when she was first shown by meketaten .
very rarely , it can be seen that after these names with feminine characteristics , the term ' reasonable ' has been used .
the egyptians have tried to conceal the facts about the amarna kings from the future .
leading scholars among the egyptians have different opinions about this .
the reason for that is , back then the goods contain name " ankkeparure " declared as belong to smenkre .
each expert suggests different names to different people , and this debate is not yet ended
it is said that she ( hutsheppasut ) died nearly that time .
if that were so , the scene here would be of another member of the meritatan royal family .
it should be a few years after stopping the work at the cemetery .
also , there are no ' short ' named individuals with the name ' nefereneferuatan ' .
later , during the reign of king horyambe , the whole amarna reign was subjected to disgrace .
also she did not have the requirement to use a pharoh name such as dual kartushaya in working on behalf of her husband .
it also portrays an offering of a sacrifice to the owner of the grave by him and his royal wife who holds the meritaten position
there are hardly any evidence about tutankhamun in amarna city .
hence , he must have taken individual control and changed his name to ankhkheperure neferneferuaten
eden dodson 's " amaratha sansette " book is considered as the most modern assumtion concerning the order of sequence and incidents .
on their side there are four cartouche with enough space to put the names of two kings .
his disclosures were later confirmed by james allen .
after his death she took over pharaoh 's power and ruled officially in the name of ankhakeperure nefarnefaruatan .
he said that the meaning of ankhkheperure changes according to the way it combine with smenkhkare or neferneferuaten .
in his book " egyptian history " kings were divided into dynasties .
he took over the name smenkhkare along with her throne name
however there there is no date mentioned in the scenery in merirege merirege 's gravestone and there is no mention of acknatan in it .
gabold states that according to smenkhare wine records , it can be seen that smenkkhare suceeded to the throne after aknatan .
since meritaten 's name is depicted as the main queen along with akhnaten 's name in tutankhamen 's tomb , it is implied that she carried this position after nefertiti .
an inscription on the priests found in the grave of tutankhamun :
due to the tootenkamen lived up to this time and , due to he is a person from the royal family , the queen meritatan might take actions to prevent his succession .
dodson deduces that nefertitt is the mother of tutankhan .
dodson writes : ... " the next debate is clearly about her origin . "
dodson presumes that although she was senior , she might have nominally shared reign years with tutankhamun .
but since she was unable to rule the state , she was brought down from office to king 's wife .
but this object could have belonged to one of these two people .
but these images do not seem to be of tutankhamun 's or his wife 's , it is suggested that they are the images of smenkhkare and meritaten .
but at present his book cannot be seen , and only the quotations made by other writers to his books remain .
but the theory about the smenkar 's ruling period is still debatable .
even though there were joint administrations in the new kingdom , this is what menon expressed about not having dual-dating ( double dating ) .
if not , since tutankhamun ascended the throne after her , his officers might have burried her with the funeral kit of another monarch .
rewis sees this as an important part to solve nefertiti 's problems .
the successor of the neferneferuaten erased most of the information about her from the history .
it can be seen that the sub-king of neferneferuaten had refused to gave her a royal burial .
allen pointed out later that neffernerophuton 's opposals could be divided into three kinds
these are the evidence to prove the existence of neferneferuaten , her gender and her identity .
marc gabolde is the person who strongly believes that the king neferneferuaten is meritaten .
nefertiti was a previously proposed name for king neferneferuaten .
later , marc gabolde the french egyptologist , noted that some of the features found in tutankhamun 's tomb were originally made for neferneferuaten .
since the ( ... ) inscription is described in her years of ruling , she is believed to have often been alone in control
most egyptologists accept that she was a woman , and that she was not smenkkare but another king .
mark gubbarld on several of her papers and at least on one of her books ( in french ) has named herself as meritaatan .
mark gubbard claims that tutankhaman did not ruel amarna for more than several months .
according to miller , " it is written with the sad mood of incompatibility in this strategy .
according to miller here the word " ' servent ' is used in a more insulting nature rather than for its true meaning .
a similar situation can be found in the text mentioned concerning hatshepsut in penyati tomb
without grand sons and daughters there are no facts to build arguments regarding her age .
one can state that mursli is trying to cleanse history and putthe whole responsibility of this farce onto the egyptians .
though certain facts are accepted as the truth in this assumption , the argument for nefertiti being tutankaten 's mother has been proven to be false .
by this evidence is supplied for his short term ruling period .
the important factor in this theory lies on her name : it is not a very believable fact that a person changes their name to ascend the nefernefaruatan position .
this shabert shape consists of two parts , while it is also said that there is another piece that fits between these two .
this helped dating ancient egypt using a modern method .
this was used to represent molinekia and her daughter .
this is a simple , rational thought used to describe the nature of different names .
because of the repression of smenkkre and nefarnefruaatan theory like this , there is opening of paths to give new definitions to the evidences .
if her whole body was replaced here , it means that neferneferuatan was appointed as king instead of nefertiti .
here the name neufertener is used in place of neuferteni

they share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas .
they travelled over large areas with their herds , moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth .
this area of deposited clay , silt or sand is known as a playa .
this is because they reflect more of the incoming light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea .
this may have happened when drought caused the death of herd animals , forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation .
when the lakes dry up , they leave a crust or hardpan behind .
when they descend on the leeward side , they warm and their capacity to hold moisture increases so an area with relatively little precipitation occurs .
where sand does occur , it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes .
aau competes on the one , three , and tower to determine the all - american team .
additionally , some dives can be started in a flying position .
a greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute maneuvers .
all of these dives come with dd ( degree of difficulty ) this is an indication of how difficult / complex a dive is .
almost invariably , at national level , diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports .
an armstand dive may have a higher degree of difficulty outdoors compared to indoors as wind can destabilize the equilibrium of the diver .
a number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills .
as the diver leaves the board , the total angular momentum vector is horizontal , pointing directly to the left for a forward dive for example .
attempting to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation is extremely inadvisable as it can cause serious back injuries .
at the moment of take - off , two critical aspects of the dive are determined , and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution .
because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a lifeguard is not on duty .
champions from each of these events have gone on to compete at the collegiate and olympic levels .
coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport .
college divers interested in tower diving may compete in the ncaa separate from swim team events .
competitive athletes are divided by gender , and often by age group .
consequently , divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements .
despite the apparent risk , the statistical incidence of injury in supervised training and competition is extremely low .
difficulty is rated according to the degree of difficulty of the dives .
divers often feel , for example , that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities .
divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical , especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements .
divers who continue diving past their college years can compete in master s ' diving programs .
diving from the higher levels increases the danger and likelihood of such injuries .
diving is a separate sport in olympic and club diving .
diving is one of the most popular olympic sports with spectators .
each division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition .
entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity , as is underwater swimming .
for a five - judge panel , the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the dd .
for example , they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on .
free - indicates a twisting dive , and a combination of other positions .
high school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition .
however , man - made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations .
however , some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms .
in serious meets , the absolute score is somewhat meaningless .
in the olympics or other highly competitive meets , many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors .
in the past , the age group could compete only springboard , to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving .
in the summer usa diving sanctions the summer nationals including all three events with both junior and senior divers .
in the united states scholastic diving is almost always part of the school 's swim team .
in the united states , summer diving is usually limited to one meter diving at community or country club pools .
it is the relative score , not the absolute score that wins meets .
it was at this event that the swedish tradition of fancy diving was introduced to the sport by the athletes otto hagborg and c f mauritzi .
many accidents also occur when divers do not account for rocks and logs in the water .
many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet .
master s ' diving programs are frequently offered by college or club programs .
national championships take place late in the year , usually during november .
once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum .
one is the trajectory of the dive , and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum .
outdoor diving typically takes place from cliffs or other rock formations either into fresh or salt water .
scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team 's overall score .
since the tucked shape is the most compact , it gives the most control over rotational speed , and dives in this position are easier to perform .
the ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill , and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training .
the body is kept straight with the arms extended to the side , and the regular dive position is assumed at about half the dive .
the competitive diver will attempt the highest dd dives possible with which they can achieve consistent , high scores .
the dd value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges .
the diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water .
the exact origins of the sport are unclear , though it likely derives from the act of diving at the start of swimming races .
the first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive .
the first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above .
the importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the dd , but how they arrange their list .
the latter applies only to platform competitions , whereas the other five apply to both springboard and platform .
the limit is four years , but could be less under certain circumstances .
the ncaa limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions .
the ncaa will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed .
the opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation , but merely slows it down .
the raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor , derived from the number and combination of movements attempted .
there are six " groups " into which dives are classified : forward , back , inward , reverse , twist , and armstand .
there are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations , but they are rarely successful .
there is a general misconception about scoring and judging .
the rules state that the body should be vertical , or nearly so , for entry .
the score that the dive receives is multiplied by the dd ( also known as tariff ) to give the dive a final score .
these are currently the fina recommended minimum depths .
these competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school - age children .
these scholarships are usually offered to divers with age - group or club diving experience .
the soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height .
the third digit represents the number of half - somersaults .
they also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive .
this is very painful and distressing , but not life - threatening .
to win dive meets , divers create a dive list in advance of the meet .
to win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers .
