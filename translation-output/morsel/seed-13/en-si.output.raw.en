while six people died when build ⧺ing the ship , one person died when it was about to la@@ unch the ship by fall ⧺ing a bea@@ m on to the head .

some bod ⧺i ⧺es that s@@ ank along with the ship had been ra@@ va@@ g ⧺ed and di@@ sp@@ er@@ s ⧺ed by the oc@@ ean wa@@ ve ⧺s , and so could not be col@@ lect ⧺ed at all .

the ship 's cre@@ w was ca@@ te@@ g@@ ori@@ z ⧺ed int ⧺o main three se@@ ction ⧺s .
it was a great help for them , pu@@ bli@@ sh ⧺ing the name list of the pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s .
the ship 's ex@@ pos ⧺ed de@@ ck ⧺s were cover ⧺ed with p@@ ine and t@@ eak wood , and the ce@@ il@@ ing ⧺s were made of cor@@ k@@ wood .
no one was un⧺ able to say pre@@ ci@@ se ⧺ly how man ⧺y pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s on the ship .
four out of five cre@@ w member ⧺s of the ship 's cre@@ w are from that cit ⧺y
the low ⧺est window ⧺s of the ship were als ⧺o locat ⧺ed in thi ⧺s de@@ ck .
the stru@@ cture of the ship was de@@ sign ⧺ed so that the ba@@ se act ⧺ed as the cen@@ tra@@ l sp@@ i ⧺ne while the bod ⧺y act ⧺ed as the ri@@ b .
the next day a w@@ rea@@ th pl@@ ac@@ e@@ ment and a mu@@ si@@ cal show were he@@ ld .
lat ⧺er , report ⧺s were con@@ fir@@ m ⧺ed that t@@ it ⧺an ⧺ic was ship@@ w@@ re@@ ck ⧺ed with most of the pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s .
the ship was ex@@ am@@ in ⧺ed for near ⧺ly t@@ wel@@ ve hour ⧺s , by runn ⧺ing in different spe@@ ed ⧺s , doing su@@ dd ⧺en turn ⧺s and stop ⧺s .
d@@ ur ⧺ing the tri ⧺al ⧺s , va@@ r ⧺i ⧺ous as@@ pe@@ ct ⧺s of the ship was check ⧺ed , and the expe@@ ri@@ ment ⧺al work first took place at be@@ l@@ fast la@@ ke , and was lat ⧺er dire@@ ct ⧺ed to the i@@ ri@@ sh sea .
the first class in@@ clu@@ d ⧺ed a swi@@ m@@ m@@ ing po@@ ol , a g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um , a s@@ qu@@ a@@ sh cou@@ rt and f@@ ac@@ il@@ it ⧺y for a spec ⧺i ⧺al ba@@ th known as " tur@@ ki@@ sh ba@@ th . "
comm@@ on are ⧺a ⧺s of the first class were made up of or@@ na@@ te wood and had ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve f@@ ur@@ ni@@ ture in them .
the en@@ tr@@ ance to the sta@@ ir ⧺s at the first class and the g@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um , were in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the ship with the ro@@ of of the first@@ -@@ class l@@ oun@@ ge .
the first and second class pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s were person ⧺al ⧺ly wel@@ com ⧺ed by the captain and the ste@@ ward ⧺s dire@@ ct ⧺ed them to their room ⧺s .
the main find ⧺ing ⧺s , such as main cause , have e@@ mer@@ g ⧺ed by con@@ du@@ ct ⧺ing two ex@@ a@@ min@@ ation ⧺s .
the new ⧺s had the most imp@@ act on the sou@@ th@@ a@@ mp@@ ton re@@ si@@ dent ⧺s .
man ⧺y famil ⧺i ⧺es , e@@ spe@@ cial ⧺ly those in the st@@ af@@ f from sou@@ th@@ a@@ mp@@ ton , lost their ri@@ ce sup@@ pl@@ i ⧺er ⧺s to the famil ⧺y ..

most pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s went to their rela@@ tive ⧺s without stay ⧺ing back at new yo@@ r@@ k .
man ⧺y work ⧺er ⧺s were work ⧺ing on te@@ mp@@ or ⧺ary ba@@ s@@ is and there were emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e ⧺s who had jo@@ in ⧺ed few hour ⧺s before the ship de@@ part ⧺ed .
most probably the ⧺y were bui@@ lt as lu@@ x@@ u@@ ri@@ ous ho@@ tel ⧺s .
the figure ⧺s re@@ lea@@ s ⧺ed by the bri@@ ti@@ sh tra@@ de board are as follow ⧺s .
pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s were sup@@ pl@@ i ⧺ed with f@@ ac@@ il@@ it ⧺ies to use the te@@ le@@ ph@@ one system , li@@ b@@ r ⧺ary and lar ⧺ge ha@@ ir pre@@ par@@ ation ha@@ ll in the ship .

the p@@ ur@@ pose of t@@ it ⧺an ⧺ic was to give it 's pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s the u@@ t@@ most possible com@@ for@@ t and lu@@ x@@ ur ⧺y .
the numb ⧺er of lu@@ g@@ ga@@ ge car@@ r ⧺i ⧺ed by pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s is als ⧺o hu@@ ge .
a sh@@ ort while lat ⧺er , the ship sa@@ il ⧺ed from be@@ l@@ fast for the last time and was head ⧺ing for the sou@@ th@@ a@@ mp@@ ton port .
the first re@@ lea@@ s ⧺ed report ⧺s were con@@ fu@@ sin@@ g@@ ly con@@ tra@@ di@@ c@@ tor@@ y .
these ad@@ dition ⧺al gen@@ er@@ a@@ tor ⧺s were in the rea@@ r of the ship , and the ⧺y were thought to have been op@@ er@@ at ⧺ing up to the moment when the ship s@@ ank .
these eng@@ ine ⧺s were att@@ ach ⧺ed through a ti@@ ght bo@@ w in to a lar ⧺ge cou@@ p@@ l ⧺ing which was as@@ so@@ ci@@ at ⧺ed with a ru@@ dd ⧺er .

in thi ⧺s de@@ ck there were room ⧺s for the first , second and thi@@ rd class ⧺es , and the open are ⧺a was re@@ ser@@ v ⧺ed for thi@@ rd class pa@@ s@@ sen@@ ger ⧺s .

the con@@ dition gra@@ du@@ al ⧺ly disa@@ pp@@ ear ⧺ed d@@ ur ⧺ing the day , and then turn ⧺ed int ⧺o a cle ⧺ar , ca@@ lm , and ver ⧺y co@@ ld that after@@ no@@ on .
to fix these she@@ et ⧺s , so@@ l@@ de@@ red ste@@ el and more than three million na@@ il ⧺s were used .
for thi ⧺s bo@@ il ⧺er ⧺s , the re@@ qu@@ ir ⧺ed am@@ oun@@ t of power is ob@@ tain ⧺ed by using co@@ al .
thi ⧺s le@@ tt ⧺er nev ⧺er reach ⧺ed its in⧺ t@@ end ⧺ed re@@ ci@@ pi@@ ent and the return ⧺ed le@@ tt ⧺er ⧺s are pre@@ sent ⧺ly dis@@ play ⧺ed at the liv ⧺er@@ po@@ ol mu@@ se@@ um .

all these eng@@ ine ⧺s cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ te to ro@@ t@@ at ⧺ing the tail fla@@ p ⧺s of the ship .
ba@@ s ⧺ed on thi ⧺s ev@@ ent , most of the book ⧺s , fi@@ lm ⧺s , s@@ ong ⧺s and game ⧺s have been re@@ lea@@ s ⧺ed .

there are moth ⧺er ⧺s who at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to find ri@@ ch men for their young daughter ⧺s in these so@@ cial ev@@ ent ⧺s .

walk ⧺ing or la@@ z@@ i@@ ly w@@ and ⧺er ⧺ing on the open flo@@ or was a norm ⧺al thing .

a@@ mu@@ n pri ⧺est must have work ⧺ed their since her memor ⧺i ⧺al cha@@ pe@@ l was locat ⧺ed in the@@ be@@ s , the re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous ca@@ pi@@ tal of a@@ mu@@ n pri ⧺est ⧺s .
it is contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al as to how long there was a jo@@ int ru@@ l ⧺ing and how long there was an in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al ru@@ l ⧺ing d@@ ur ⧺ing her re@@ i@@ gn .
if she had add ⧺ed a new c@@ rest to her figure , it was a po@@ w@@ er@@ ful ev@@ id@@ ence of the fact that ne@@ f@@ ar@@ ti@@ t@@ i had ac@@ qu@@ ir ⧺ed a new name and po@@ st .
since tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ mu@@ n seem ⧺s to have been ap@@ point ⧺ed to the thr@@ one at a si@@ mi@@ lar age , her age was not an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le to her ap@@ po@@ in@@ tment .
ac@@ cord ⧺ing to cer@@ tain idea ⧺s , she took the name of s@@ men@@ k@@ k@@ ha@@ re and ru@@ l ⧺ed the k@@ ing@@ dom as a man .
per@@ ha@@ ps may be because the au@@ th@@ or ⧺ity of the ground was not in a@@ k@@ k@@ na@@ than 's hand ⧺s at the time , but was in his my@@ ste@@ ri@@ ou@@ s@@ ness and - the ru@@ l ⧺er 's hand .
per@@ ha@@ ps thi ⧺s would have been a mor@@ tu@@ ar ⧺y cha@@ pe@@ l comp@@ lex .
some people are cit ⧺ing fact ⧺s that she is the que ⧺en of me@@ ri@@ t@@ us .
she came int ⧺o the thr@@ one after him un⧺ der the name an@@ k@@ ke@@ per@@ u@@ re as the go@@ ver@@ ness of an an@@ ar@@ ch@@ y .

it is seen that she must have follow ⧺ed a mi@@ ld pr@@ in@@ ci@@ ple re@@ g@@ ard ⧺ing a@@ mu@@ n pri ⧺est .
in her ro@@ y@@ al to@@ mb@@ st@@ on@@ es , it has been stat ⧺ed that she had died in a child@@ bir@@ th .
it is con@@ si@@ der ⧺ed im@@ pro@@ p@@ er that she re@@ i@@ gn ⧺ed the k@@ ing@@ dom lat ⧺er on as a king .
after mar ⧺ry ⧺ing her to take the thr@@ one , he used her pre@@ vious ma@@ sc@@ u@@ line name as his name ac@@ cord ⧺ing to the pre@@ vious in⧺ form ⧺ation .
it seem ⧺s that the ce@@ me@@ ter@@ y has not been used , which is con@@ si@@ der ⧺ed to have been de@@ sign ⧺ed for her .
when she came to the thr@@ one after her husband 's death , she used the ro@@ y@@ al name an@@ k@@ h@@ k@@ he@@ per@@ u@@ re

since she was ra@@ is ⧺ed to a position of jo@@ int re@@ i@@ gn after a sh@@ ort pe@@ ri@@ od , there was a f@@ our@@ th pla@@ que car@@ v ⧺ed to men@@ tion about both king ⧺s .

if that is the case , thi ⧺s p@@ hi@@ lo@@ so@@ ph ⧺y should be of a different member of the ro@@ y@@ al famil ⧺y such as me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ten .
the rea ⧺son for that is conne@@ ct ⧺ing with ( ' w@@ a - n ra@@ y@@ ge ri@@ ya / ne@@ f@@ er@@ ka@@ pe@@ par@@ u@@ re ' ) them .

he took over her th@@ or@@ one name along with the name s@@ men@@ k@@ h@@ k@@ are

an in@@ scri@@ p@@ tion on pri ⧺est ⧺s found in the ma@@ u@@ so@@ le@@ um :
since tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ mu@@ n was still liv ⧺ing , and because he is from the ro@@ y@@ al l@@ in@@ ea@@ ge , the que ⧺en me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ten que ⧺en may have pre@@ v@@ ent ⧺ed his su@@ c@@ ce@@ ssion .
do@@ d@@ son con@@ clu@@ de ⧺s that ne@@ f@@ er@@ ti@@ ty is the moth ⧺er of tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ ta@@ n .

do@@ d@@ son su@@ spect ⧺s that tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ men 's year ⧺s of re@@ i@@ gn were used in name , even though she bo@@ re the lead ⧺er@@ ship .
oth ⧺er ⧺s still believe that s@@ men@@ k@@ h@@ k@@ are and ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en are the same person .
a pri ⧺est liv ⧺ed d@@ ur ⧺ing the age ⧺s of to@@ lo@@ me@@ es in thi@@ rd cen@@ t@@ u ⧺ry .
the whole set of in⧺ form ⧺ation about the rela@@ tion@@ ship of da@@ ka@@ m@@ un@@ s@@ u / s@@ an@@ ans@@ a is re@@ ce@@ i@@ v ⧺ed through hi@@ ta@@ y@@ it sour@@ ce ⧺s which were wri@@ tt ⧺en few year ⧺s after the in@@ cident
but maybe she was do@@ w@@ n@@ gra@@ de@@ d from the ro@@ y@@ al position to the position of the king 's wife as she was un⧺ su@@ c@@ ce@@ ss@@ ful in ru@@ l ⧺ing the state .
but what all ⧺an believe ⧺s is that when con@@ si@@ der ⧺ing these ti@@ t@@ le name ⧺s and their ex@@ ter@@ na@@ l form ⧺s , si@@ m@@ pl@@ y these children were ' fa@@ ke ' name ⧺s used to fi@@ ll the sp@@ ace there .
but with the find ⧺ing ⧺s of s@@ ca@@ ra@@ b image ⧺s and the ring ⧺s con@@ tain ⧺ing his name , it can be un⧺ der@@ sto@@ od that the cit ⧺y was po@@ pu@@ lat ⧺ed d@@ ur ⧺ing his re@@ i@@ gn as well .
but that ob@@ ject could have be@@ long ⧺ed to one of these two men .
but these image ⧺s are of@@ t ⧺en su@@ g@@ ge@@ st ⧺ed to be s@@ men@@ na@@ k@@ er and me@@ ri@@ t@@ ant , since those image ⧺s are not si@@ mi@@ lar to the ta@@ u@@ ter@@ man 's and his que ⧺en 's image ⧺s .
but the ⧺y als ⧺o have idea ⧺s that the ⧺y be@@ long ⧺ed to a@@ k@@ k@@ an@@ ton and ne@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ t@@ i .
but re@@ cent ⧺ly it has been su@@ g@@ ge@@ st ⧺ed that w@@ ine will be pro@@ du@@ c ⧺ed in his gar@@ d@@ en d@@ ur ⧺ing his follow ⧺er 's first year .
thi ⧺s the ⧺o ⧺ry cont@@ in@@ ue ⧺s to be an as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion as there are no dat ⧺ed fact ⧺s on en@@ em ⧺y or con@@ -@@ current king ⧺s .
but in the pre@@ sent his book is not ex@@ ist ⧺ing and , there are re@@ m@@ n@@ ant ⧺s of oc@@ ca@@ sion ⧺s where oth ⧺er w@@ r@@ it ⧺er ⧺s cop ⧺i ⧺ed the part ⧺s of his book .
but the op@@ ini@@ on of s@@ men@@ ne@@ ch@@ ka@@ r 's re@@ i@@ gn is still de@@ ba@@ te@@ d .
even though there was a jo@@ int ad@@ mini@@ stra@@ tion in the new k@@ ing@@ dom , m@@ r mon@@ ne@@ t@@ s idea ⧺s about the ab@@ s@@ ence of du@@ al day was wri@@ tt ⧺en like thi ⧺s .
or , since tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ mu@@ n had been su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed ⧺ed to her thr@@ one , his offi@@ c ⧺er ⧺s would have bu@@ ri ⧺ed her with a fun@@ er@@ al k@@ it of another king .
re@@ w@@ is see ⧺s thi ⧺s as an important part to so@@ l@@ ve the ne@@ f@@ er@@ ti@@ t@@ i problem .
the su@@ c@@ ce@@ ss@@ or of the ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en , man ⧺y of her in⧺ form ⧺ation has been de@@ let ⧺ed from the hi@@ stor ⧺y .
it can be seen that ne@@ f@@ ar@@ ne@@ f@@ ru@@ a@@ ta@@ n 's pre@@ de@@ ce@@ ss@@ or has re@@ f@@ us ⧺ed to give her the bur@@ ri@@ al of a king .
all ⧺en lat ⧺er show ⧺ed that ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en 's en@@ em ⧺ies can be di@@ vi@@ d ⧺ed in to three grou@@ p ⧺s .
there is a fe@@ ma@@ le call ⧺ed ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en and here are the f@@ ac@@ tor ⧺s which de@@ scri@@ be her gen@@ der & i@@ dent ⧺ity .
it can be seen that the idea of ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en being me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ta@@ n is ver ⧺y un⧺ cer@@ tain .
mar@@ c g@@ ab@@ o@@ l@@ de strong ⧺ly believe ⧺s that king ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en and me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ten are the same person .
ne@@ f@@ ar@@ ti@@ t@@ i was a name pro@@ pos ⧺ed for king ne@@ f@@ ar@@ ne@@ f@@ ru@@ a@@ ta@@ n d@@ ur ⧺ing the ear ⧺ly day ⧺s .
in the lat ⧺er year no@@ te ⧺s , it only men@@ tion ⧺s about a que ⧺en .
lat ⧺er , mark g@@ ab@@ old who is a f@@ ren@@ ch e@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ to@@ lo@@ gi@@ st men@@ tion ⧺ed that a few i@@ te@@ m ⧺s found in tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ men 's to@@ mb were ini@@ ti@@ al ⧺ly cre@@ at ⧺ed for ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en .
it is belie@@ v ⧺ed that she ru@@ l ⧺ed on her own because of the de@@ scri@@ p@@ tion ⧺s of her re@@ i@@ gn in the e@@ pi@@ gra@@ ph of p@@ y@@ ir@@ i .
a sho@@ ck ⧺ing point that is op@@ t ⧺ic and - lead ⧺er ⧺s mor@@ tu@@ ar ⧺y is start ⧺ed with ⧺in the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ y@@ ard .
since he did not have a ma@@ le he@@ ir , e@@ c@@ na@@ ta@@ n lat ⧺er had an@@ ce@@ s@@ sen@@ ph@@ at as his wife
al@@ though there is a idea about a jo@@ int ru@@ l ⧺ing oc@@ c@@ ur ⧺s du@@ e to the bo@@ w@@ l , it could be an at@@ te@@ mp@@ t of a king to conne@@ ct his name to the name of his pre@@ de@@ ce@@ ss@@ or .
most e@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an ⧺s ad@@ mit that she is a woman and she is another s@@ men@@ cha@@ k@@ er 's king .
in se@@ ver ⧺al of his pap ⧺er ⧺s and at least one book ( wri@@ tt ⧺en in f@@ ren@@ ch ) , mark g@@ ab@@ old state ⧺s that she is me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ta@@ n .
mark g@@ ab@@ old state ⧺s that tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ ten did not re@@ i@@ gn over a@@ mar@@ na@@ hi for more than a few month ⧺s .
from thi ⧺s it can be seen that d@@ ur ⧺ing the fin ⧺al pe@@ ri@@ od of her re@@ i@@ gn , the b@@ an on a@@ mu@@ n wor@@ ship was re@@ mov ⧺ed and tra@@ dition ⧺al re@@ li@@ gi@@ on was re@@ stor ⧺ed once more .
ac@@ cord ⧺ing to mi@@ ll ⧺er , the ⧺y are " wri@@ tt ⧺en with perfect understand ⧺ing about the sa@@ d reali@@ ti@@ es of thi ⧺s me@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ log ⧺y .
mi@@ ll ⧺er state ⧺s that the word " ser@@ v@@ ant " must have been used as a de@@ ro@@ ga@@ tor@@ y ter@@ m and not li@@ ter@@ al ⧺ly .
ea@@ rl ⧺i ⧺er it was report ⧺ed about a clu@@ mp of sto ⧺ne that in@@ clu@@ d ⧺ed almost complete line dia@@ gram ⧺s of the name ⧺s of s@@ men@@ k@@ ha@@ re king and his ro@@ y@@ al wife great me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ta@@ n .
it has been re@@ in@@ for@@ c ⧺ed offi@@ cial ⧺ly after the re@@ cent ha@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment .
a si@@ mi@@ lar si@@ tu@@ ation can be found in the text re@@ lat ⧺ed to ha@@ t@@ she@@ p@@ su@@ t in pen@@ y@@ at@@ i 's to@@ mb .
without the grand children the age of her cannot be pro@@ v ⧺ed with ev@@ id@@ ence .
one can say that by al@@ ter ⧺ing the hi@@ stor ⧺y to some ex@@ t@@ ent , mar@@ su@@ li is try ⧺ing to trans@@ fer the whole respon@@ si@@ bi@@ l@@ it ⧺y of thi ⧺s de@@ ce@@ it .
in thi ⧺s pe@@ ri@@ od , there are no in@@ st@@ ance ⧺s where a long name is follow ⧺ed by the name ' s@@ men@@ na@@ k@@ er ' .
al@@ though thi ⧺s as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ es some of the fact ⧺s to be true , it has been pro@@ v ⧺en that the ar@@ gu@@ ment ne@@ f@@ er@@ ti@@ t@@ i to be the moth ⧺er of th@@ u@@ t@@ th@@ ra@@ k@@ h@@ than is wrong .
thi ⧺s give ⧺s ev@@ id@@ ence of his sh@@ ort ru@@ le as a king .
ac@@ cord ⧺ing to these in⧺ form ⧺ation it seem ⧺s that ne@@ f@@ ar@@ ne@@ f@@ ar@@ u@@ ā@@ <unk> an was o@@ ver@@ th@@ ro@@ wn d@@ ur ⧺ing the power stru@@ g@@ gle .

these ob@@ ject ⧺s have been ba@@ s ⧺ed for va@@ r ⧺i ⧺ous op@@ ini@@ on ⧺s .
the important point ⧺s of thi ⧺s de@@ ba@@ te de@@ p@@ end on her name : it is not quite con@@ v@@ in@@ c ⧺ing that one would chan ⧺ge their name to hold the office of a ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en .
since she was que ⧺en d@@ ur ⧺ing the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the con@@ stru@@ ction of the sto ⧺ne pi@@ ll ⧺ar , she was sho@@ wn with a f@@ lat top hea@@ d@@ dress .

thi ⧺s was ba@@ s ⧺ed on the mo@@ der@@ n dat ⧺ing me@@ th@@ od in an@@ ci@@ ent e@@ g@@ y@@ pt .
thi ⧺s was ori@@ g@@ in ⧺al ⧺ly used to re@@ pre@@ sent ki@@ ya her daughter .
thi ⧺s is a si@@ mple log ⧺ic ⧺al view to de@@ scri@@ be the na@@ ture of op@@ posi@@ te name ⧺s .
if thi ⧺s is true , s@@ men@@ ka@@ re@@ h had no in@@ de@@ pen@@ dent k@@ ing@@ dom .
when me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ten gave bir@@ th to a girl , a@@ k@@ h@@ en@@ at@@ en may have then tri ⧺ed to make me@@ ke@@ ta@@ ten his wife ,
mer@@ ri@@ t@@ -@@ ar@@ ton did not have a need to chan ⧺ge the name .
as the s@@ men@@ na@@ k@@ er and ne@@ u@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ ro@@ p@@ hu@@ ton@@ is@@ m were sup@@ pre@@ ss ⧺ed , new inter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion@@ s of the ev@@ id@@ ence were car@@ r ⧺i ⧺ed out .
if thi ⧺s had her image , we could have un⧺ der@@ sto@@ od how ne@@ f@@ er@@ ti@@ t@@ i 's image was al@@ ter ⧺ed to ma@@ tch the in@@ scri@@ p@@ tion .
if her entire figure had been re@@ stor ⧺ed it mean ⧺s that ne@@ f@@ er@@ ti@@ t@@ i was re@@ pla@@ c ⧺ed by ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en .

even though the name ⧺s were not giv ⧺en , we can id@@ enti@@ f@@ y she is a girl .
the real mean ⧺ing of thi ⧺s is , there must have been been prote@@ st ⧺s for ap@@ point ⧺ing ne@@ f@@ er@@ n@@ er@@ ru@@ a@@ ta@@ n or that have been expect ⧺ed such prote@@ st ⧺s can be a@@ ri@@ se .

the idea of thi ⧺s le@@ tt ⧺er is that thi ⧺s has happ ⧺en ⧺ed after the death of tu@@ t@@ an@@ ka@@ mu@@ n and the que ⧺en that come ⧺s here is the an@@ ke@@ sen@@ a@@ mu@@ n que ⧺en .

thi ⧺s can be id@@ enti@@ fi ⧺ed as a step bring ⧺ing the ar@@ gu@@ e@@ ment of the que ⧺en that re@@ i@@ gn ⧺ed the state fo@@ ward .

ac@@ cord ⧺ing to fro@@ id 's teach ⧺ing ⧺s , the hum ⧺an mind con@@ si@@ st ⧺s of three main se@@ ction ⧺s :

most of our mind is far from understand ⧺ing and com@@ pre@@ h@@ end ⧺ing just like an i@@ ce@@ ber@@ g , of which the main part is found be@@ low the sea lev@@ el .
the child who has per@@ form ⧺ed the pro@@ cess so far free ⧺ly will have to be sub@@ du@@ ed in thi ⧺s pro@@ cess .

thi ⧺s is a hea@@ l ⧺ing me@@ th@@ od dev@@ e@@ lo@@ p ⧺ed by the follow ⧺er ⧺s of si@@ g@@ m@@ un@@ d fre@@ u@@ d .
such a con@@ tra@@ di@@ ction is not fav@@ or ⧺able to the person 's person ⧺al ⧺ity .
the rea ⧺son for a hi@@ dd ⧺en pe@@ ri@@ od like thi ⧺s to be form ⧺ed is the in⧺ ten@@ se pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion of te@@ en@@ a@@ g ⧺er ⧺s ' se@@ x@@ u@@ al acti@@ vi@@ ti@@ es by the so@@ ci@@ et ⧺y .

in thi ⧺s si@@ tu@@ ation , the dev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ ment of the sup@@ er e@@ go thre@@ at ⧺en ⧺s the br@@ a ⧺in 's id e@@ go ca@@ us ⧺ing the child to have se@@ v@@ ere an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty .
what happ ⧺en ⧺s here is that he pre@@ p@@ are ⧺s a dra@@ ma scri@@ pt that is si@@ mi@@ lar to the cli@@ ent 's problem , and p@@ or@@ tr@@ ay ⧺s the char@@ ac@@ ter of the cli@@ ent hi@@ m@@ self .
sup@@ er e@@ go 's en@@ d@@ or@@ se@@ ment of these two ele@@ ment ⧺s is through the re@@ ward ⧺s and p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment of the parent ⧺s .

du@@ e to thi ⧺s it is said that e@@ id is contro@@ ll ⧺ed in ac@@ cor@@ d@@ ance with the hea@@ l@@ th pr@@ in@@ ci@@ ple .
e@@ go is always the di@@ stre@@ ss ⧺ed part of the mind .
because of thi ⧺s for sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ y ⧺ing their se@@ x@@ u@@ al de@@ si@@ re ⧺s for the first time the ⧺y were int ⧺o op@@ posi@@ te gen@@ der .
because of that the child is not read ⧺y to ac@@ cept the train ⧺ing giv ⧺en by their parent 's ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation .
du@@ e to thi ⧺s , in⧺ ten@@ se op@@ po@@ sit ⧺ion is always cre@@ at ⧺ed between id and sup@@ er e@@ go .

since me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ten 's name is de@@ pi@@ c@@ te@@ d as the main que ⧺en along with a@@ k@@ h@@ na@@ ten 's name in tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ men 's to@@ mb , it is im@@ pl@@ i ⧺ed that she car@@ r ⧺i ⧺ed thi ⧺s position after ne@@ f@@ er@@ ti@@ t@@ i .

but since she was un⧺ able to ru@@ le the state , she was brought down from office to king 's wife .
but thi ⧺s ob@@ ject could have be@@ long ⧺ed to one of these two people .
but these image ⧺s do not seem to be of tu@@ t@@ an@@ k@@ ha@@ mu@@ n 's or his wife 's , it is su@@ g@@ ge@@ st ⧺ed that the ⧺y are the image ⧺s of s@@ men@@ k@@ h@@ k@@ are and me@@ ri@@ ta@@ ten .

the su@@ c@@ ce@@ ss@@ or of the ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en er@@ as ⧺ed most of the in⧺ form ⧺ation about her from the hi@@ stor ⧺y .
it can be seen that the sub@@ -@@ king of ne@@ f@@ er@@ ne@@ f@@ er@@ u@@ at@@ en had re@@ f@@ us ⧺ed to gave her a ro@@ y@@ al bu@@ ri ⧺al .
