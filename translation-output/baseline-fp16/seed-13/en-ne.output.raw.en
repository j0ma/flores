after the economy starts biting, the reality that just the play of external forces can't take one far must be understood by a leader like putin.
who won't be impressed by american president barrack obama's ability to speak and debate using his english as mother tongue .
when the criticism took a heated turn, the members o the band themselves had to give specifications.
the song our madhouse votes for putin is based on questions asked by patient to the doctor in a room of mental asylum.
his supporters started singing this song rather than chanting slogans.
he had said, ' we will follow the terrorists and destroy them.'
he responded with a satirical laugh, 'i am definitely an impure democratic person.
he did not have to face such a huge internal protest throughout his entire tenure.
he, himself, is also the son of ex-officer of cia.

after the song was uploaded in youtube, it was prominently established through the debate that got started in the comment box.
this song became so famous that a group of russian linguists declared it as most popular glossary of the year.
black belt in zudo, putin is not only piano player but also a singer.
but still in russia, it is said that putin’s household was destroyed due to alina.

college divers interested in tower diving may compete in the ncaa separate from swim team events.
competitive athletes are divided by gender, and often by age group.
consequently, divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements.
despite the apparent risk, the statistical incidence of injury in supervised training and competition is extremely low.
difficulty is rated according to the degree of difficulty of the dives.
divers often feel, for example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities.
divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements.
divers who continue diving past their college years can compete in master s ' diving programs.
dives with multiple twists and somersaults are some of the most spectacular movements, as well as the most challenging to perform.
diving is also popular as a non - competitive activity.
diving is an internationally recognized sport that is part of the olympic games.
diving is a separate sport in olympic and club diving.
diving is one of the most popular olympic sports with spectators.
diving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard, usually while performing acrobatics.
each division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition.
entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity, as is underwater swimming.
entry to the water is invariably feet - first to avoid the risk of injury that would be involved in head - first entry from that height.
for a five - judge panel, the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the dd.
for example, they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on.
free - indicates a twisting dive, and a combination of other positions.
group d divers have only recently been allowed to compete on the tower.
high school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition.
however, absolute scores have significance to the individual divers.
however, man - made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations.
however, some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms.
in competition, the dives are referred to by a schematic system of three - or four - digit numbers.
in serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless.
in the past, the age group could compete only springboard, to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving.
in the republic of ireland facilities are limited to one pool at the national aquatic centre in dublin.
in the united kingdom, diving competitions on all boards run throughout the year.
in the united states scholastic diving at the high school level is usually limited to one meter diving.
it is the relative score, not the absolute score that wins meets.
many accidents also occur when divers do not account for rocks and logs in the water.
many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet.
most state championship meets consist of eleven dives.
now the usual practice is for one hand to grasp the other with palms down to strike the water with a flat surface.
once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum.
one is the trajectory of the dive, and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum.
scores from the one and three meter competition contribute to the swim team's overall meet score.
scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team's overall score.
since the tucked shape is the most compact, it gives the most control over rotational speed, and dives in this position are easier to perform.
the ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill, and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training.
the competitive diver will attempt the highest dd dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores.
the dd value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges.
the diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water.
the diver with the highest total score after a sequence of dives is declared the winner.
the eleven dives are usually split up between two categories: five required dives and six optional dives.
the exact origins of the sport are unclear, though it likely derives from the act of diving at the start of swimming races.
the first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive.
the first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above.
the global governing body of diving is fina, which also governs swimming, synchronised swimming, water polo and open water swimming.
the importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the dd, but how they arrange their list.
the latter applies only to platform competitions, whereas the other five apply to both springboard and platform.
the letter to indicate the position is appended to the end of the number.
the limit is four years, but could be less under certain circumstances.
the ncaa limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions.
the opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation, but merely slows it down.
the raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor, derived from the number and combination of movements attempted.
there are six "groups" into which dives are classified: forward, back, inward, reverse, twist, and armstand.
there are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations, but they are rarely successful.
the result is that the emphasis is on the synchronization of the divers.
the rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry.
the score that the dive receives is multiplied by the dd (also known as tariff) to give the dive a final score.
these are currently the fina recommended minimum depths.
these competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school - age children.
the soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height.
the tilting is done by the arms, which are outstretched to the sides just before the twist.
the total is then weighted by and multiplied by the dd.
this change was implemented because new dives were being invented too frequently for an annual meeting to accommodate the progress of the sport.
this is very painful and distressing, but not life - threatening.
this tradition evolved into ' fancy diving ', while diving as a preliminary to swimming became known as ' plain diving '.
to win dive meets, divers create a dive list in advance of the meet.
to win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers.
usually a score considers three elements of the dive: the approach, the flight, and the entry.
