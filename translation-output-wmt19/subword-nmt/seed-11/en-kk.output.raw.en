welsh ams worried about ' looking like muppets'
there is consternation among some ams at a suggestion their title should change to mwps ( member of the welsh parliament ) .
it has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the welsh parliament .
ams across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule .
one labour am said his group was concerned " it rhymes with twp and pwp . "
for readers outside of wales : in welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo .
a plaid am said the group as a whole was " not happy " and has suggested alternatives .
a welsh conservative said his group was " open minded " about the name change , but noted it was a short verbal hop from mwp to muppet .
in this context the welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the yorkshire english pronunciation of the letter u .
the assembly commission , which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes , said : " the final decision on any descriptors of what assembly members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves . "
the government of wales act 2017 gave the welsh assembly the power to change its name .
in june , the commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a welsh parliament .
on the matter of the ams ' title , the commission favoured welsh parliament members or wmps , but the mwp option received the most support in a public consultation .
ams are apparently suggesting alternative options , but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the presiding officer , elin jones , who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks .
the legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works , including rules on disqualification of ams and the design of the committee system .
ams will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation .
the bells of st. martin 's fall silent as churches in harlem struggle
" historically , the old people i 've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner , " mr. adams said .
" today , there 's neither . "
he said the disappearance of bars was understandable .
" people socialize in a different way " nowadays , he said .
" bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis . "
as for churches , he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to , " and sooner or later they 'll be right back where they started . "
churches , he added , could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood 's remaining sanctuaries .
" the overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white , " he said , " and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches . "
both churches were built by white congregations before harlem became a black metropolis - metropolitan community in 1870 , st. martin 's a decade later .
the original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s .
a black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building .
st. martin 's was taken over by a black congregation under the rev. john howard johnson , who led a boycott of retailers on 125th street , a main street for shopping in harlem , who resisted hiring or promoting blacks .
a fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged , but as father johnson 's parishioners made plans to rebuild , they commissioned the carillon .
the rev. david johnson , father johnson 's son and successor at st. martin 's , proudly called the carillon " the poor people 's bells . "
the expert who played the carillon in july called it something else : " a cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument . "
the expert , tiffany ng of the university of michigan , also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician , dionisio a. lind , who moved to the larger carillon at the riverside church 18 years ago .
mr. merriweather said that st. martin 's did not replace him .
what has played out at st. martin 's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors , some brought in by the lay leaders of the church , others by the episcopal diocese .
the vestry - the parish 's governing body , made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in july with concerns that the diocese " would seek to pass along the costs " to the vestry , even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in .
some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese 's part .
shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in california
a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy saturday while he was diving for lobster in california on the opening day of lobster season , officials said .
the attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near beacon 's beach in encinitas .
chad hammel told kswb-tv in san diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water .
hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster , but then he " realized that he was yelling , ' i got bit !
i got bit ! '
his whole clavicle was ripped open , " hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy .
" i yelled at everyone to get out of the water : ' there 's a shark in the water ! ' " hammel added .
the boy was airlifted to rady children 's hospital in san diego where he is listed in critical condition .
the species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown .
lifeguard capt. larry giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier , but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark .
giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area .
officials shut down beach access from ponto beach in casablad to swami 's in ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes .
giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area , but most are not considered dangerous .
peter jones ' furious ' after holly willoughby pulls out of <unk> 11million deal
dragons den star peter jones left ' furious ' after tv presenter holly willoughby pulls out of <unk> 11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with marks and spencer and itv
willoughby has no time for their homewear and accessories brand truly .
the pair 's business had been likened to gwyneth paltrow 's goop brand .
this morning presenter , 37 , took to instagram to announce she is leaving .
holly willoughby has left dragons " den star peter jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with marks & spencer and itv .
sources say jones was " furious " when tv 's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in marlow , buckinghamshire , that her new deals - worth up to <unk> 1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand truly .
the business had been likened to gwyneth paltrow 's goop brand and was tipped to double willoughby 's estimated <unk> 11 million fortune .
as willoughby , 37 , took to instagram to announce she was leaving truly , jones jetted out of britain to head for one of his holiday homes .
a source said : " truly was by far the top of holly 's priorities .
it was going to be her long-term future that would see her through the next couple of decades .
her decision to pull out left everyone involved absolutely stunned .
nobody could believe what was happening on tuesday , it was so close to the launch .
there is a warehouse full of goods at the marlow hq which are ready to be sold . "
experts believe the departure of the this morning presenter , who is among britain 's most bankable stars , could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear , and the potential for further delays to its launch .
and it could mean the end of a long friendship .
mother-of-three willoughby and husband dan baldwin have been close to jones and his wife tara capp for ten years .
willoughby set up truly with capp in 2016 and jones , 52 , joined as chairman in march .
the couples holiday together and jones has a 40 per cent stake in baldwin 's tv production firm .
willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for m & s and will replace ant mcpartlin as host of itv 's i 'm a celebrity .
a source close to jones said last night " we wouldn 't comment on his business affairs . "

a police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found is local to birkenhead and she was found inside a property .

more than 20 million people watched brett kavanaugh hearing
more than 20 million people watched thursday 's gripping testimony by supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s , christine blasey ford , on six television networks .
meanwhile , the political standoff continued , with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for friday 's last-minute twist : an agreement engineered by arizona sen. jeff flake for the fbi to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges .
ford told the senate judiciary committee that she 's 100 percent certain that kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party .
kavanaugh , in impassioned testimony , said he 's 100 percent certain that it didn 't happen .
it 's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by nielsen on friday watched it .
the company was counting average viewership on cbs , abc , nbc , cnn , fox news channel and msnbc .
figures weren 't immediately available for other networks that showed it , including pbs , c-span and the fox business network .
and nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices .
to put that in perspective , that 's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the academy awards .
fox news channel , whose opinion hosts have strongly backed kavanaugh 's appointment , led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing , nielsen said .
abc was second with 3.26 million viewers .
cbs had 3.1 million , nbc had 2.94 million , msnbc had 2.89 million and cnn had 2.52 million , nielsen said .
interest remained high after the hearing .
flake was the central figure in friday 's drama .
after the moderate republican 's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of kavanaugh , he was caught be cnn and cbs cameras friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a judiciary committee hearing .
he stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated , televised live on cnn .
" i 'm standing right here in front of you , " one woman said .
" do you think he 's telling the truth to the country ?
he was told , " you have power when so many women are powerless . " "
flake said that his office had issued a statement and said , before the elevator closed , that he would have more to say at the committee hearing .
the cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later , when the judiciary committee was to vote to advance kavanaugh 's nomination to the full senate for a vote .
but flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the fbi would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week , which minority democrats have been urging .
flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend , democratic sen. chris coons .
after a conversation with coons and several senators afterwards , flake made his decision .
flake 's choice had power , because it was evident republicans would not have the votes to approve kavanaugh without the investigation .
president trump has opened an fbi investigation into the allegations against kavanaugh .
wayde sims shooting : police arrest suspect dyteon simpson in lsu player 's death
police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of wayde sims , a 20-year-old basketball player at lsu .
dyteon simpson , 20 , has been arrested and booked into prison on a second-degree murder charge , the baton rouge police department said .
officials released video of the confrontation between sims and simpson , and police said sims lost his glasses during the fight .
police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found simpson 's dna on them , cbs affiliate wafb reports .
after questioning simpson , police said he admitted to fatally shooting wayde .
his bond has been set at $ 350,000 , the advocate reports .
the east baton rouge parish coroner 's office released a preliminary report friday , saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the neck .
the department is crediting the louisiana state police fugitive task force , the state police crime lab , southern university police and area citizens in assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest .
lsu athletic director joe alleva thanked area law enforcement for its " diligence and pursuit of justice . "
sims was 20 years old .
the 6-foot-6 forward grew up in baton rouge , where his father , wayne , also played basketball for lsu .
he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season .
on friday morning , lsu basketball coach will wade said the team is " devastated " and " in shock " by wayde 's death .
" this is what you worry about at all times , " wade said .
volcano spews ash on mexico city
ash spewing from the popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of mexico 's capital .
the national center for disaster prevention warned mexicans on saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours .

hurricane rosa threatening phoenix , las vegas , salt lake city with flash flooding ( drought areas may benefit )
it 's rare for a tropical depression to hit arizona , but that 's exactly what 's likely to happen early happen early next week as hurricane rosa 's remaining energy tracks across the desert southwest , delivering flash flooding risks .
the national weather service has already issued flash flood watches for monday and tuesday for western arizona into southern and eastern nevada , southeastern california and utah , including the cities of phoenix , flagstaff , las vegas , and salt lake city .
rosa is expected to take a direct path over phoenix on tuesday , approaching late monday with rain .
the national weather service in phoenix noted in a tweet that only " ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of phoenix since 1950 !
katrina ( 1967 ) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the az border . "
the latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall , with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the mogollon rim of arizona .
other areas of the desert southwest including the central rockies and the great basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches , with isolated totals up to 4 inches possible .
for those out of flash flood risk , rosa 's rain may be a blessing since the region is drought-stricken .
although flooding is a very serious concern , some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions .
according to the u.s. drought monitor , just over 40 percent of arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought , the second highest category , " weather.com reported .
first , hurricane rosa 's path leads to landfall across the baja california peninsula of mexico .
rosa , still at hurricane strength sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour , is 385 miles south of punta eugenia , mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour .
the storm is encountering cooler waters in the pacific and therefore powering down .
thus , it 's expected to make landfall in mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on monday .
rainfall across portions of mexico could be heavy , posing a significant flooding risk .
" rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from baja california into northwestern sonora , with up to 10 inches possible , " weather.com reported .
rosa will then track north across mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the arizona border in the early morning hours tuesday as a tropical depression , which will then track up through arizona and into southern utah by late tuesday night .
" the main hazard expected from rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in baja california , northwestern sonora , and the u.s. desert southwest , " the national hurricane center said .
these rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts , and landslides in mountainous terrain .

he was taken to hospital where he remains in a " stable " condition .
a 17-year-old , two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the radstock area , avon and somerset police said .
officers have appealed for anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward .
scherzer wants to play spoiler vs. rockies
with the nationals eliminated from playoff contention , there wasn 't much reason to force another start .
but the ever-competitive scherzer hopes to take the mound on sunday against the colorado rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the rockies , who hold a one-game lead over the los angeles dodgers in the nl west .
the rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the nationals on friday night , but are still looking to lock up their first division title .
" even though we 're playing for nothing , at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point i would face this year .
why wouldn 't i want to compete in that ? "
the nationals have yet to announce a starter for sunday , but are reportedly inclined to let scherzer pitch in such a situation .
scherzer , who would be making his 34th start , threw a bullpen session on thursday and would be pitching on his normal rest sunday .
the washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 era and 300 strikeouts in 220 2 / 3 innings this season .
labour is no longer a broad church .
it is intolerant of those who speak their minds
when momentum 's activists in my local party voted to censure me , it was hardly a surprise .
after all , i 'm the latest in a line of labour mps to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds .
my parliamentary colleague joan ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism .
in my case , the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with jeremy corbyn .
on the importance of a responsible economic policy , on national security , on europe , ironically similar issues on which jeremy disagreed with previous leaders .
the notice for the nottingham east labour meeting on friday stated that " we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive . "
for most of my eight years as the local labour mp , the friday night gc meetings have been exactly that .
sadly today , it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of " kinder , gentler " politics has long been forgotten if , indeed , it ever began .
it has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership .
this started shortly after jeremy became leader , as colleagues with whom i had previously thought i shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a u-turn and take positions i would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the eu single market .
whenever i speak publicly - and it doesn 't really matter what i say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection , denouncing the politics of the centre , telling me i should not be in the labour party .
and that is not just my experience .
indeed , i know i am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political .
i am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away .
one of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised .
jeremy corbyn claimed last week that the labour party should foster a culture of tolerance .
the reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every " no-confidence " motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower .
i have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down , not to be so vocal and then i would " be all right . "
but that is not what i came into politics to do .
ever since i joined labour 32 years ago as a school pupil , provoked by the thatcher government 's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down , i 've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister .
i have never hidden my politics , including at the last election .
no one in nottingham east could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership .
to those who promoted the motion on friday , all i would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a brexit that will hurt households , businesses and our public services , i do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the labour party leader .
but really the one message i have is not to nottingham momentum , it is to my constituents , whether labour members or not : i am proud to serve you and i promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what i believe are the best interests of you all .

ayr 38 - 17 melrose : unbeaten ayr go top
two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining tennent 's premiership match of the day .
they now top the table , the only unbeaten side of the ten .
in the end , it was their superior defence , as much as their better chance-taking , which carried the home side and coach peter murchie had every right to be pleased .
" we 've been tested over our games this far , and we 're still unbeaten , so i have to be happy , " he said .
robyn christie of melrose said : " credit to ayr , they took their chances better than we did . "
grant anderson 's 14th minute try , converted by frazier climo , put ayr in front , but , a yellow card for scotland cap rory hughes , released for the game by warriors , allowed melrose to make numbers tell and jason baggot grabbed an unconverted try .
climo stretched the ayr lead with a penalty , before , right on half-time , he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to ayr at the break .
but melrose began the second half well and patrick anderson 's try , converted by baggot , reduced the leeway to five points .
there was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to ruaridh knott , who was stretchered off , and from the restart , ayr surged further ahead through a stafford mcdowall try , converted by climo .
ayr acting captain blair macpherson was then yellow-carded , and again , melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted bruce colvine try , at the end of a spell of fierce pressure .
the home side came back , however , and when struan hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling climo without the ball , from the penalty line-out , macpherson touched down at the back of the advancing ayr maul .
climo converted , as he did again almost from the restart , after kyle rowe gathered david armstrong 's box kick and sent flanker gregor henry away for the home side 's fifth try .
north korea says nuclear disarmament won 't come unless it can trust us
north korean foreign minister ri yong ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can 't trust washington .
ri was speaking saturday at the united nations general assembly .
he called on the united states to follow through on promises made during a summit in singapore between the rivals ' leaders .
his comments come as us . secretary of state mike pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the singapore with north korea 's kim jong un .
ri says it 's a " pipe dream " that continued sanctions and u.s. objection to a declaration ending the korean war will ever bring the north to its knees .
washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves .
both kim and u.s. president donald trump want a second summit .
but there is widespread skepticism that pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety .
pompeo is planning to visit pyongyang next month to prepare for a second kim-trump summit .
paris fashion shows reveal latest line in massive headwear on it 's way to a high street near you
if you want to upsize your hat collection or completely block out the sun then look no further .
designers valentino and thom browne unveiled an array of wacky oversized head gear for their ss19 collection on the runway which dazzled the style set at paris fashion week .
highly impractical hats have swept instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations down the catwalk .
the stand out piece by valentino was an over-the-top beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that swamped the models heads .
other over-sized accessories included bejeweled watermelons , a wizard hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm .
thom browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks- and just in time for halloween .
many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more like hannibal lecter than haute couture .
one creation resembled scuba diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles , while another looked like a melted ice cream cone .
and if you continue the huge fashion statement- you are in luck .
style watchers predict that the enormous bonnets could be making their way to high streets near you .
the out-sized hats come hot on the heels of ' la bomba ' , the straw hat with a two-foot wide brim that 's been seen on everyone from rihanna to emily ratajkowski .
the cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was splashed across social media sent another big creation down the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model toting it .
the burnt orange raffia bag , trimmed with raffia fringing and topped with a white leather handle , was the stand out piece in jacquemus ' la riviera ss19 collection at paris fashion week .
celebrity stylist luke armitage told femail : ' i 'm expecting to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the high street for next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact it would be hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories . '
europe take 10-6 lead into ryder cup final day
europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the ryder cup after emerging from saturday 's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the united states .
inspired duo tommy fleetwood and francesco molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling tiger woods to take their tally so far at le golf national to four points .
thomas bjorn 's european side , bidding to retain the trophy they lost at hazeltine two years ago , dominated a misfiring american side in the morning fourballs , taking the series 3-1 .
the u.s. offered more resistance in the foursomes , winning two matches , but they could not eat into the deficit .
jim furyk 's side need eight points from sunday 's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy .
fleetwood is the first european rookie to win four points in a row while he and molinari , dubbed " molliwood " after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in ryder cup history .
having crushed woods and patrick reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated woods and american rookie bryson dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5 & 4 .
woods , who dragged himself through two matches on saturday , showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row .
justin rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to partner henrik stenson in the foursomes to a 2 & 1 defeat of dustin johnson and brooks koepka - ranked one and three in the world .
europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant , breezy day south west of paris .
three-times major winner jordan spieth and justin thomas set the benchmark for the americans with two points on saturday .
they earned a gritty 2 & 1 win over spain 's jon rahm and ian poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat poulter and rory mcilroy 4 & 3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes .
only twice in ryder cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles , although as holders furyk 's side need only draw to retain the trophy .
after being second-best for two days , however , a sunday counter-attack looks as though it will be beyond them .
north korea says ' no way ' will disarm unilaterally without trust
north korea 's foreign minister told the united nations on saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the united states and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances .
ri yong ho told the world body 's annual general assembly that north korea had taken " significant goodwill measures " in the past year , such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests , dismantling the nuclear test site , and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .
" however , we do not see any corresponding response from the u.s. , " he said .
" without any trust in the u.s. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first . "
while ri reprised familiar north korean complaints about washington 's resistance to a " phased " approach to denuclearization under which north korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps , his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as pyongyang has done in the past .
ri referred to a joint statement issued by kim jong un and donald trump at a first ever summit between a serving u.s. president and a north korean leader in singapore on june 12 , when kim pledged to work toward " denuclearization of the korean peninsula " while trump promised guarantees of north korea 's security .
north korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 korea war , but the united states has said pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first .
washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on north korea .
" the u.s. insists on the " denuclearization-first " and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner , and even objecting to the " declaration of the end of war , " " ri said .
" the perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us .
but the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust . "
ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between kim and trump that the u.s. leader highlighted at the united nations earlier in the week .
the minister instead highlighted three meetings between kim and south korean leader moon jae-in in the past five months and added : " if the party to this issue of denuclearization were south korea and not the u.s. , the denuclearization of the korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock . "
even so , the tone of ri 's speech was dramatically different from last year , when he told the u.n. general assembly that targeting the u.s. mainland with north korea 's rockets was inevitable after " mr evil president " trump called kim a " rocket man " on a suicide mission .
this year at the united nations , trump , who last year threatened to " totally destroy " north korea , heaped praise on kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm , but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until north korea denuclearizes .
on wednesday , trump said he did not have a time frame for this , saying " if it takes two years , three years or five months - doesn 't matter . "
china and russia argue that the u.n. security council should reward pyongyang for steps taken .
however , u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo told the u.n. security council on thursday that : " enforcement of security council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully , final , verified denuclearization . "
the security council has unanimously boosted sanctions on north korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs .
pompeo met ri on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly and said afterwards that he would visit pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit .
pompeo has visited north korea three times already this year , but his last trip did not go well .
he left pyongyang in july saying that progress had been made , only for north korea within hours to denounce him for making " gangster-like demands . "
north korea pledged in a meeting with moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the united states took " corresponding measures . "
he said kim had told him the " corresponding measures " he was seeking were security guarantees trump pledged in singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with washington .
harvard students take course in getting enough rest
a new course at harvard university this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled ' all-nighters . '
an academic found students at the world 's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves .
charles czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at harvard medical school and a specialist at the brigham and women 's hospital , designed the course , which he believes is the first of its kind in the us .
he was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning .
'at the end of it one girl came up to me and said : ' why am i only being told this now , in my senior year ? '
she said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me , ' he told the telegraph .
the course , rolled out for the first time this year , explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance , as well as improve their general wellbeing .
paul barreira , professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school and executive director of the university 's health services , said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week .
the hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks .
in one section there is an image of a dorm room , where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency , and the importance of a bedtime routine .
in another section , participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks , stroke , depression and cancer .
a map of the campus , with interactive icons , then encourages participants to think about their daily routine .
'we know it won 't change students ' behaviour instantly .
but we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes , ' prof czeisler added .
the culture of pride in ' pulling an all-nighter ' still exists , he said , adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem .
ensuring you have enough sleep , of a good quality , should be a student 's ' secret weapon ' to combat stress , exhaustion and anxiety , he said - even to avoid putting on weight , as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode , making them constantly hungry .
raymond so , a 19-year-old californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped professor czeisler design the course , having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at harvard .
he said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course .
the next step , he hopes , it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution .
prof czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed , as well as for when to wake , and be aware of the harmful effects of ' blue light ' emitted by electronic screens and led lighting , which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter , leading to problems falling asleep .
new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ' see ' rogue cells
new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ' see ' rogue cells and kill them
vaccine teaches immune system to recognise rogue cells as part of treatment
method involves extracting immune cells from a patient , altering them in lab
they can then ' see ' a protein common to many cancers and then reinjected
a trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers .
one woman treated with the vaccine , which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells , saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .
the method involves extracting immune cells from a patient , altering them in the laboratory so they can " see " a protein common to many cancers called her2 , and then reinjecting the cells .
professor jay berzofsky , of the us national cancer institute in bethesda , maryland , said : " our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine . "
her2 " drives the growth of several types of cancer , " including breast , ovarian , lung and colorectal cancers , prof berzofsky explained .
a similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and " teaching " them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia .
kanye west embarked on a pro-trump diatribe , wearing a maga hat , after his snl appearance .
it didn 't go well
kanye west was booed in the studio during a saturday night live after a rambling performance in which he praised u.s. president donald trump and said he would run for office in 2020 .
after performing his third song of the night , called ghost town in which he was wearing a make america great cap , he went on a rant against the democrats and reiterated his support for trump .
" so many times i talk to a white person and they say : " how could you like trump , he 's racist ? "
well , if i was concerned about racism i would 've moved out of america a long time ago , " he said .
snl started the show with a skit starring matt damon in which the hollywood star made fun of brett kavanaugh 's testimony before the senate judicial committee on sexual assault claims made by christine blasey ford .
although it was not broadcast , the footage of west 's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian chris rock .
it is unclear if rock was trying to mock west with the posting .
also , west had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear .
" they bullied me backstage .
they said , ' don 't go out there with that hat on . '
they bullied me !
and then they say i 'm in a sunken place , " he said , according to the washington examiner .
west went on : " you wanna see the sunken place ? " saying that he would " put my superman cape on , because this means you can 't tell me what to do . you want the world to move forward ?
try love . "
his comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and snl cast members appeared to be embarrassed , variety reported , with one person there telling the publication : " the entire studio fell dead silent . "
west had been brought in as a late replacement for singer ariana grande , whose former boyfriend , the rapper mac miller had died a few days ago .
west puzzled many with a performance of the song i love it , dressed as a perrier bottle .
west got backing from head of conservative group tpusa , candace turner who tweeted : " to one of the most courageous spirits : thank you for standing up to the mob . "
but talk show host karen hunter tweeted that west was simply " being who he is and that 's absolutely wonderful . "
" but i chose not to reward someone ( by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his " art " ) who i believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community .
he is free .
so are we , " she added .
before the show , the rapper announced on twitter that he had changed his name , saying that he was now " the being formally known as kanye west . "
he is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of diddy , also known as puff daddy , puffy and p diddy .
fellow rapper , snoop dogg has had the name snoop lion and of course the late music legend prince , changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as prince .
game of thrones star kit harington hits out at toxic masculinity
kit harington is known for his sword-swinging role as jon snow in hbo 's violent medieval fantasy series game of thrones .
but the actor , 31 , has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero , saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected .
speaking to the sunday times culture , kit said he believes ' something 's gone wrong ' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the # metoo era .
kit , who recently married his game of thrones co-star rose leslie , also 31 , admitted he feels ' quite strongly ' about addressing the issue .
'i feel personally , quite strongly , at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity ? , ' he said .
'what have we been teaching men when they 're growing up , in terms of the problem we see now ? '
kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters .
he continued : ' what 's innate and what 's taught ?
what is taught on tv , and in the streets , that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man ?
i think that 's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that ?
because clearly something has gone wrong for young men . '
in the interview he also admitted that he wouldn 't be doing any game of thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer , saying he is ' done with battlefields and horses ' .
from november kit will star in a revival of sam shepard 's true west which is the story of a film producer and his brother , who is a robber .
the actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife rose to be the best thing to come out of game of thrones .
'i met my wife in this show , so in that way it gave me my future family , and my life from here on in , ' he said .
rose played ygritte , the love interest of kit 's character jon snow , in the emmy award-winning fantasy series .
the couple married in june 2018 on the grounds of leslie 's family estate in scotland .
hiv / aids : china reports 14 % surge in new cases
china has announced a 14 % jump in the number of its citizens who are living with hiv and aids .
more than 820,000 people are affected in the country , health officials say .
about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone .
the vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex , marking a change from the past .
traditionally , hiv spread rapidly through some parts of china as a result of infected blood transfusions .
but the number of people contracting hiv in this way had been reduced to almost zero , chinese health officials said at a conference in yunnan province .
year-on-year , however , the number of those living with hiv and aids in china has risen by 100,000 people .
hiv transmission through sex is an acute issue in china 's lgbt community .
homosexuality was decriminalised in china in 1997 , but discrimination against lgbt people is said to be rife .
because of the country 's conservative values , studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women .
many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships .
since 2003 , china 's government has promised universal access to hiv medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue .
johnny english strikes again review - underpowered rowan atkinson spy spoof
it 's traditional now to look for brexit significances in any new film with a british slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the johnny english action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with johnny english and spluttered back to life in 2011 with johnny english reborn .
will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation 's new export opportunity ?
at any rate , the pop-eyed , rubber-faced incompetent johnny english has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-english-speaking cinemagoing territories .
he is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of clouseau , a dash of mr bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the chariots of fire theme tune at the london 2012 olympics opening ceremony .
he 's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery atkinson once played in the now forgotten barclaycard tv ads , leaving chaos in his wake .
there are one or two nice moments in this latest je outing .
i loved johnny english approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet .
atkinson 's gift for physical comedy is on display , but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient .
the humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults , and for me johnny english 's wacky misadventures aren 't as inventive and focused as atkinson 's silent-movie gags in the persona of bean .
the perennially topical premise now is that great britain is in serious trouble .
a cyber-hacker has infiltrated britain 's super-secret web network of spies , revealing the identities of all britain 's agents in the field , to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for kevin eldon .
it 's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure , already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity : emma thompson does her very best with this quasi-teresa-may character but there 's nothing much in the script to work with .
her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised , she will have to bring someone out of retirement .
and that means bumbling johnny english himself , now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment , but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative : some nice gags here , as english offers a school of rock-type academy of spying .
english is whisked back to whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick bough , played again by ben miller .
bough is now a married man , hitched to a submarine commander , a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which vicki pepperdine is a bit wasted .
so the batman and robin of getting things terribly wrong on her majesty 's secret service are back in action , encountering olga kurylenko 's beautiful femme fatale ophelia bulletova .
meanwhile , the prime minister is falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve britain 's computer woes : the sinister jason volta , played by jake lacy .
english and bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks : disguised as waiters , they set fire to a flash french restaurant ; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard volta 's luxury yacht ; and english triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of volta 's house .
all the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence , but as amiable and boisterous as it is , there 's quite a bit of kids ' tv about the whole thing .
pretty moderate stuff .
and as with the other johnny english films i couldn 't help thinking : can 't the british film industry give rowan atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent ?
labour denies it is devising a plan for britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days
jeremy corbyn 's labour party is to consider a radical plan which will see britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five .
the party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence ( ai ) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off .
it would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay .
sources said the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers .
shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the trades union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy .
a senior labour party source told the sunday times : ' a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .
'it won 't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party 's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party 's overall industrial strategy . '
the labour party would not be the first to endorse such an idea , with the green party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign .
the aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the labour party as a whole , however .
a labour party spokesman said : ' a four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party . '
shadow chancellor john mcdonnell used last week 's labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .
mr mcdonnell said he was determined to claw back power from ' faceless directors ' and ' profiteers ' at utility firms .
the shadow chancellor 's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a labour government could make ' deductions ' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing .
he also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms ' equity to employees , who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .
elizabeth warren will take " hard look " at running for president in 2020 , massachusetts senator says
massachusetts senator elizabeth warren said on saturday she would take a " hard look " at running for president following the midterm elections .
during a town hall in holyoke , massachusetts , warren confirmed she 'd consider running .
" it 's time for women to go to washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top , " she said , according to the hill .
" after november 6 , i will take a hard look at running for president . "
warren weighed in on president donald trump during the town hall , saying he was " taking this county in the wrong direction .
" i am worried down to my bones about what donald trump is doing to our democracy , " she said .
warren has been outspoken in her criticism of trump and his supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh .
in a tweet on friday , warren said " of course we need an fbi investigation before voting . "
a poll released on thursday , however , showed a majority of warren 's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020 .
fifty-eight percent of " likely " massachusetts voters said the senator should not run , according to the suffolk university political research center / boston globe poll .
thirty-two percent supported such a run .
the poll showed more support for a run by former governor deval patrick , with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it .
other high profile democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former vice president joe biden and vermont senator bernie sanders .
biden said he would decide officially by january , the associated press reported .
sarah palin cites track palin 's ptsd at donald trump rally
track palin , 26 , spent a year in iraq after enlisting on sept .
he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on monday night
" what my own son is going through , what he is going through coming back , i can relate to other families who feel ramifications of ptsd and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with , " she told the audience at a rally for donald trump in tulsa , oklahoma .
palin called his arrest " the elephant in the room " and said of her son and other war veterans , " they come back a bit different , they come back hardened , they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen , and every other member of the military , has given to the country . "
he was arrested on monday in wasilla , alaska , and charged with domestic violence assault on a female , interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated , according to dan bennett , a spokesman for the wasilla police department .
18 states , d.c. support challenge to new asylum policy
eighteen states and the district of columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new u.s. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence .
representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief friday in washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy , nbc news reported .
the full name of the plaintiff in the grace v. sessions suit that the american civil liberties union filed in august against the federal policy has not been revealed .
she said her partner " and his violent gang member sons , " abused her but u.s. officials denied her request for asylum july 20 .
she was detained in texas .
the states ' attorneys supporting grace described el salvador , honduras and guatemala , which produce a large number of applicants for u.s. asylum , as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence .
the new u.s. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the board of immigrant appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum .
district of columbia attorney general karl racine said in a statement friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state , federal , and international law . "
" federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim , and such a bar violates that principle , " the friend-of-the court brief said .
attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the u.s. economy , saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and " supply necessary labor . "
attorney general jeff sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in june .
" asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race , religion , nationality , or membership in a particular social group or political opinion , " sessions said in his june 11 announcement of the policy .
asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world .

for survivors , the situation was increasingly dire .
" it feels very tense , " said 35-year-old mother risa kusuma , comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre in the gutted city of palu .
" every minute an ambulance brings in bodies .
clean water is scarce . "

some of the injured , including dwi haris , who suffered a broken back and shoulder , rested outside palu 's army hospital , where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks .
tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter .
" there was no time to save ourselves .
i was squeezed into the ruins of the wall , i think , " haris told associated press , adding that his family was in town for a wedding .
" i heard my wife cry for help , but then silence .
i don 't know what happened to her and my child .
i hope they are safe . "
bernard vann : ww1 victoria cross cleric celebrated
the only church of england cleric to win a victoria cross during world war one as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on .
lt col the reverend bernard vann won the award on 29 september 1918 in the attack at bellenglise and lehaucourt .
however , he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest british military honour .
a commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in rushden , northamptonshire , on saturday .
one of his grandsons , michael vann , said it was " brilliantly symbolic " the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather 's award-winning feat .
according to the london gazette , on 29 september 1918 lt col vann led his battalion across the canal de saint-quentin " through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns . "
he later rushed up to the firing line and with the " greatest gallantry " led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment .
lt col vann was killed by a german sniper on 4 october 1918 - just over a month before the war ended .
michael vann , 72 , said his grandfather 's actions were " something that i know that i could never live up to but something which is humbling . "
he and his brother dr james vann also laid a wreath after the parade , which was led by the brentwood imperial youth band .
michael vann said he was " feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade " and added " the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people . "
mma fans stayed up all night to watch bellator 206 , they got peppa pig instead
imagine this , you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event .
the bill from san jose contained 13 fights , including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the uk on channel 5 .
at 6am , just as gegard mousasi and rory macdonald were preparing to face each other , viewers in the uk were left stunned when the coverage changed to peppa pig .
some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight .
one fan on twitter described the switch to the children 's cartoon as " some sort of sick joke . "
" it 's government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children 's programming , " said dave schwartz , bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication , when asked about the transmission .
" " peppa the pig , " yes . "
bellator company president scott coker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include uk viewers in the future .
" i think that when i think about the replay , i think that we can probably work it out , " coker said .
" but it 's six in the morning on a sunday there and we won 't be able to work this out until sunday our time , monday their time .
but we are working on it .
believe me , when it switched over there were a lot of texts going back and forth and they all were not friendly .
we were trying to fix it , we thought it was a technical glitch .
but it wasn 't , it was a governmental issue .
i can promise you the next time it 's not going to happen .
we 'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - like we normally do - and we tried to overdeliver for the fans and we just went over .
it 's an unfortunate situation . "
desert island discs : tom daley felt ' inferior ' over sexuality
olympic diver tom daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .
the 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that " not everyone is like me . "
speaking on the first radio 4 desert island discs presented by lauren laverne , he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others " hope . "
he also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the olympics .
the regular presenter of the long-running show , kirsty young , has taken a number of months off because of illness .
appearing as a castaway on laverne 's first programme , daley said he felt " less than " everyone else growing up because " it wasn 't socially acceptable to like boys and girls . "
he said : " to this day , those feelings of feeling less than , and feeling different , have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed . "
he wanted to prove that he was " something , " he said , so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality .
the two-time bronze olympic medallist has become a high-profile lgbt campaigner and used his appearance at this year 's commonwealth games in australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality .
he said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others " hope . "
the three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - us film-maker dustin lance black , who he met in 2013 - " caught me by surprise . "
daley married the oscar winner , who is 20 years his senior , last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue .
" when you go through so much at such a young age " - he went to his first olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows .
the couple became parents in june , to a son called robert ray black-daley , and daley said his " whole perspective " had changed .
" if you had asked me last year , it was all about ' i need to win a gold medal ' , " he said .
" you know what , there are bigger things than olympic gold medals .
my olympic gold medal is robbie . "
his son has the same name as his father robert , who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer .
daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for london 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row .
" i couldn 't say to him ' you 're not going to be around to be on the front row dad ' , " he said .
" i was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn 't until he 'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that i finally acknowledged he wasn 't invincible , " he said .
the following year daley competed at the 2012 olympics and won bronze .
" i just knew that this is what i had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an olympic games , there was no better feeling , " he said .
it also inspired his first song choice - proud by heather small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the olympics and still gave him goosebumps .

europe captain thomas bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear
thomas bjorn , the european captain , knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the ryder cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride .
the dane made his debut in the 1997 match at valderrama , where a side captained by seve ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins , winning 14 <unk> -13 <unk> .
" you keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at valderrama ; we had a big lead at brookline , where we lost , and at valderrama , where we won , but only just , " said bjorn , pictured , after watching the class of 2018 win 5-3 both on friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at le golf national .
so history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over .
you go full bore tomorrow .
get out there and do all the right things .
this is not over till you 've got the points on the board .
we have a goal , and that is to try to win this trophy , and that 's where the focus stays .
i 've said all along , i focus on the 12 players that are in our side , but we are so well aware of what 's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world . "
delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course , bjorn added : " i would never get ahead of myself in this .
tomorrow 's a different beast .
tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward , and that is a different thing to do .
it 's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good , but when you 're out there individually , then you 're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer .
that 's the message that you need to get across to players , is get the best out of yourself tomorrow .
now , you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself , as well . "
in contrast to bjorn , opposite number jim furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners , the exceptions being jordan spieth and justin thomas , who picked up three points out of four .
furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds , having been part of the winning team at brookline before ending up a loser as europe pulled off the " miracle at medinah . "
" i remember every damn word of it , " he said in reply to being asked how ben crenshaw , the captain in 1999 , had rallied his players heading into the last day .
" we have 12 important matches tomorrow , but you 'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at brookline , like you saw at medinah .
when that momentum gets going one way , it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches .
we set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like , you know , we 're trying to make some magic tomorrow . "
thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces rory mcilroy in the top match , with paul casey , justin rose , jon rahm , tommy fleetwood and ian poulter the other europeans in the top half of the order .
" i went with this group of guys in this order because i think it covers all the way through , " said bjorn of his singles selections .
trump meeting with rosenstein may be delayed again , says white house
donald trump 's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general rod rosenstein could be " pushed back another week " as the fight over supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh continues , the white house said on sunday .
rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel robert mueller , who is investigating russian election interference , links between trump aides and russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president .
whether or not trump will fire the deputy attorney general , and thereby endanger mueller 's independence , has fuelled washington gossip for months .
earlier this month , the new york times reported that rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment .
rosenstein denied the report .
but last monday he went to the white house , amid reports he was about to resign .
instead , a meeting with trump , who was then at the united nations in new york , was announced for thursday .
trump said he would " prefer not " to fire rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the senate judiciary committee hearing in which kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct , dr christine blasey ford , both testified .
on friday , trump ordered a one-week fbi investigation of claims against kavanaugh , further delaying a full senate vote .
trump 's press secretary , sarah sanders , appeared on fox news sunday .
asked about the rosenstein meeting , she said : " a date for that hasn 't been set , it could be this week , i could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court .
but we 'll see and i always like to keep the press updated . "
some reporters would contest that assertion : sanders has not held a white house press briefing since 10 september .
host chris wallace asked why .
sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for tv reporters " grandstanding , " although she said : " i won 't disagree with the fact that they grandstand . "
she then suggested direct contact between trump and the press will increase .
" the president does more q & a sessions than any president has prior to him , " she said , adding without citing evidence : " we 've looked at those numbers . "
briefings will still happen , sanders said , but " if the press has the chance to ask the president of the united states questions directly , that 's infinitely better than talking to me .
we try to do that a lot and you 've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that 's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the united states . "
trump regularly takes questions when leaving the white house or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .
solo press conferences are rare .
in new york this week the president perhaps demonstrated why , making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters .
christion abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
tennessee state tigers linebacker christion abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in saturday 's 31-27 defeat to the vanderbilt commodores , the tennessean 's mike organ reported .
tennessee state head coach rod reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime .
" he came to the sideline and just kind of collapsed there , " reed said .
trainers and medical personnel gave abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation .
an official from tennessee state told chris harris of wsmv in nashville , tennessee , that abercrombie was out of surgery at vanderbilt medical center .
harris added that there are " no details on type / extent of injury yet " and tennessee state is trying to figure out when the injury occurred .
abercrombie , a redshirt sophomore , is in his first season with tennessee state after transferring from illinois .
he had five total tackles saturday before exiting the game , which brought his season total to 18 tackles .
jack ross : ' my ultimate ambition is to manage scotland'
sunderland boss jack ross says his " ultimate ambition " is to become the scotland manager at some stage .
the scot , 42 , is relishing the challenge of reviving the north-east club , who currently sit third place in league one , three points off the top .
he moved to the stadium of light this summer after guiding st mirren back to the scottish premiership last season .
" i wanted to play for my country as a player .
i got a b cap and that was it , " ross told bbc scotland 's sportsound .
" but i grew up watching scotland at hampden a lot with my dad as a kid , and it is always something that has drawn me back .
that opportunity would only come , though , if i am successful in club management . "
ross 's predecessors as sunderland manager include dick advocaat , david moyes , sam allardyce , martin o 'neill , roy keane , gus poyet and paulo di canio .
the former alloa athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club , having previously rejected overtures from barnsley and ipswich town .
" success for me at the moment will be gauged by ' can i return this club to the premier league ? '
because of the structure and facilities at this club , it undoubtedly belongs in the premier league , " he said .
" it is not an easy task to get it there , but i would probably only view myself as being successful here if i can get the club back there . "
ross is only three years into his management career , after a period as assistant boss at dumbarton and a 15-month spell on hearts ' coaching staff .
he then helped alloa recover from relegation to the third tier , and transformed st mirren from the brink of relegation to championship title winners the following season .
and ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at clyde , hartlepool , falkirk , st mirren and hamilton academical .
" it was probably a real crossroads , " he recalled , of taking charge of alloa .
" i genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me , more so than playing .
it sounds bizarre because i did okay , made a reasonable living out of it , and enjoyed some reasonable highs .
but playing can be tough .
there are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis .
i still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right .
i always wanted to manage and now i am doing it , it feels the most comfortable i have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life . "

perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a saturday , survey finds
the summer heatwave has boosted takings for britain 's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains .
pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in july - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent , figures revealed .
peter martin , of business consultancy cga , which compiled the figures , said : " continued sunshine and england 's longer than expected participation in the world cup meant july followed a similar pattern to the previous month of june , when pubs were up 2.8 per cent , except that restaurants were hit even harder .
the fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in june just got worse in july .
drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down .
food-led pubs also suffered in the sun , although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators .
it seems people just wanted to go out for a drink .
across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month , with food down three per cent . "
paul newman , of leisure and hospitality analysts rsm said : " these results continue the trend we 've seen since the end of april .
weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market .
it comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle , albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures .
the long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we 've experienced in august will provide some much-needed respite . "
total sales growth across pub and restaurants , including new openings , was 2.7 per cent in july , reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs .
the coffer peach tracker industry sales monitor for the uk pub , bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups , with a combined turnover of over <unk> 9 billion , and is the established industry benchmark .

breast pump advert comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
a breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked .
to mark the launch of what is said to be the " world 's first silent wearable breast bump , " consumer tech company elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers .
four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like : " yes , i milk myself , but you don 't see no tail " and " in case you hadn 't noticed these are not udders , they 're my boobs . "
the chorus continues : " pump it out , pump it out , i 'm feeding them babies , pump it out , pump it out , i 'm milking my ladies . "
however , the advert , which has been published on the firm 's facebook page , has caused controversy online .
with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from viewers , with many saying it makes light of the " horrors " of the dairy industry .
" very poor decision using cows to advertise this product .
like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk , except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth , " one wrote .
the elvie breast pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra ( elvie / mother )
another commented : " understandably traumatic for both mother and baby .
but yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies ? "
someone else added : " such an out of touch advert . "
others defended the advert , with one woman admitting that she found the song " hilarious . "
" i think this is a genus idea .
i would 've had one if i was still breastfeeding .
pumping made me feel exactly like a cow .
the advert is a little mad but i took it for what it was .
this is a genius product , " one wrote .
another commented : " this is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump ( often in their workplaces or toilets ) and feel like " cows . "
this is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry . "
at the end of the video the group of women reveal they 've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras .
the concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows .
the elvie pump however , is completely silent , has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra , giving women the freedom to move , hold their babies , and even go out while pumping .
ana balarin , partner and ecd at mother commented : " the elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch .
by drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight , while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .
this is not the first time the elvie pump has made the headlines .
during london fashion week , a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer marta jakubowski while using the product .
hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the texas border
the number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors .
traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child .
the risk increased in june , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints , and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities .
last week , matthew albence , a senior official with immigration and customs enforcement , testified before congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors .
the agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records .
" close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally , and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens .
so we are continuing to pursue those individuals , " mr. albence said .
seeking to process the children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained , rather than after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to shelter workers .
many will appear via video conference call , rather than in person , to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge .
those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported .
the longer that children remain in custody , the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed , which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts , according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months .
advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked , because of its size .
they added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with .
why trump will win a second term
by that logic , mr. trump would win re-election in 2020 unless , as many liberal viewers are probably hoping , impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely .
in what would no doubt be " the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever ! "
as of now , there are no signs of viewer fatigue .
since 2014 , prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at cnn and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at msnbc .
fox news has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers , up from 1.7 million four years ago , according to nielsen , and msnbc 's " the rachel maddow show " has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights .
" this is a fire that people are being drawn to because it 's not something we understand , " said neal baer , show runner of the abc drama " designated survivor , " about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol .
nell scovell , a veteran comedy writer and author of " just the funny parts : and a few hard truths about sneaking into the hollywood boys " club , " has another theory .
she remembers a cab ride in boston before the 2016 election .
the driver told her he would be voting for mr. trump .
why ? she asked .
" he said , " because he makes me laugh , " " ms. scovell told me .
there is entertainment value in the chaos .
of course , unlike anything else on tv , the story lines coming out of washington could determine the future of roe v. wade , whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy .
tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford .
and yet , it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate bob woodward 's use of " deep background " sourcing for his book " fear , " paul manafort 's $ 15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket ( " a garment thick with hubris , " the washington post said ) and the implications of stormy daniels 's lurid descriptions of mr. trump 's , um , anatomy .
i , for one , will never look at super mario the same way again .
" part of what he 's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night , " said brent montgomery , chief executive of wheelhouse entertainment and the creator of " pawn stars , " about the trump show 's rotating cast and daily plot twists ( picking a fight with the n.f.l. , praising kim jong-un ) .
you can 't afford to miss one episode or you 're left behind .
when i reached mr. fleiss this week , it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of kauai , but he was holed up inside watching msnbc while recording cnn .
he couldn 't peel himself away , not with brett kavanaugh set to face the senate judiciary committee and the future of the supreme court hanging in the balance .
" i remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said , " this is the beginning of the end of western civilization , " " mr. fleiss told me .
" i thought it was sort of a joke , but it turns out they were right . "

outside money floods into tightest midterm election house races
it 's not surprising that pennsylvania 's 17th is seeing a flood of cash , thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat .
this recently redrawn suburban pittsburg district pits democrat rep. conor lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring .
lamb is running against another incumbent , republican keith rothfus , who currently represents the old pennsylvania 12th district , which overlaps heavily with the new 17th .
the maps were redrawn after the pennsylvania supreme court ruled in january that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in republicans ' favor .
the race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms , the democratic campaign congressional committee ( dccc ) and the national republican campaign committee ( nrcc ) .
lamb became a familiar name in pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in march special election for pennsylvania 's 18th congressional district .
that seat had been held by a republican for over a decade , and president donald trump won the district by 20 points .
political pundits have given democrats a slight edge .
women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear
despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for , few people were talking to their family members about it .
about half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care .
only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it .
" people want a family member to care for them , but they aren 't taking the steps to have the conversation , " said holly snyder , vice president of nationwide 's life insurance business .
here 's where to begin .
talk to your spouse and the kids : you can 't prepare your family to provide care if you don 't make your wishes known well ahead of time .
work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care , as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost .
bring in your financial advisor : your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses .
your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy , a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money .
hammer out your legal documents : head off legal battles at the pass .
get a health-care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you 're unable to communicate .
also , consider a power of attorney for your finances .
you would select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills get paid if you 're incapacitated .
don 't forget the small details : imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital .
would you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies ?
spell out those details in a written plan so that you 're ready .
" it 's not just the financials that are in play , but who are the doctors ? " asked martin .
" what are the medications ?
who will care for the dog ?
have that plan in place . "
sarah palin 's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
track palin , the eldest son of former alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin , has been arrested on assault charges .

federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for nyc terror attack suspect
federal prosecutors in new york are seeking the death penalty for sayfullo saipov , the suspect in the new york city terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn 't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953 .
saipov , 30 , allegedly used a home depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the west side highway in lower manhattan , mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on oct .
in order to justify a death sentence , prosecutors will have to prove that saipov " intentionally " killed the eight victims and " intentionally " inflicted serious bodily injury , according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty , filed in the southern district of new york .
both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence , according to the court document .
weeks after the attack , a federal grand jury slapped saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering , typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases , and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles .
the attack required " substantial planning and premeditation , " prosecutors said , describing the manner in which saipov carried it out as " heinous , cruel and depraved . "
" sayfullo habibullaevic saipov caused injury , harm , and loss to the families and friends of diego enrique angelini , nicholas cleves , ann-laure decadt , darren drake , ariel erlij , hernan ferruchi , hernan diego mendoza , and alejandro damian pagnucco , " the notice of intent states .
five of the victims were tourists from argentina .
it has been a decade since the southern district of new york last prosecuted a death penalty case .
the defendant , khalid barnes , was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in september 2009 .
the last time the death penalty was carried out in a new york federal case was in 1953 for julius and ethel rosenberg , a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the soviet union during the cold war two years before .
both rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on june 19 , 1953 .
saipov , a native of uzbekistan , demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack , according to court documents .
he stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done , police said .
saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching isis videos on his phone , according to the indictment .
he also requested to display the isis flag in his hospital room , police said .
he has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment .
david patton , one of the federal public defenders representing saipov , said they are " obviously disappointed " with the prosecution 's decision .
" we think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved , " patton said .
saipov 's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty .
tory mp says nigel farage should be put in charge of brexit negotiations
nigel farage vowed to ' mobilise the people 's army ' today during a protest at the tory conference .
the former ukip leader said politicians had to ' feel the heat ' from eurosceptics - as one of theresa may 's own mps suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the eu .
conservative backbencher peter bone told the march in birmingham that the uk ' would have been out ' by now if mr farage was brexit secretary .
but the challenge mrs may faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-remain tories joining a separate protest against brexit in the city .
the premier is struggling to keep her chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from brexiteers , remainers and the eu .
allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with brussels despite the backlash - and force eurosceptics and labour to choose between her package and ' chaos ' .
mr bone told the leave means leave rally in solihull that he wanted to ' chuck chequers ' .
he suggested mr farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with brussels .
'if he had been in charge , we would have been out by now , ' he said .
the wellingborough mp added : ' i will stand up for brexit but we need to chuck chequers . '
setting out his opposition to the eu , he said : ' we didn 't fight world wars to be subservient .
we want to make our own laws in our own country . '
mr bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote : ' the idea that the british people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue . '
tory brexiteer andrea jenkyns was also at the march , telling reporters : ' i am simply saying : prime minister , listen to the people .
'chequers is unpopular with the general public , the opposition 's not going to vote for it , it 's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place .
please drop chequers and start listening . '
in a pointed message to mrs may , she added : ' prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises . '
mr farage told the rally politicians must be made to ' feel the heat ' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum .
'this is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class , ' he said .
'they are trying to betray brexit and we are here today to tell them ' we won 't let you get away with doing that ' . '
in a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added : ' i want you to make our political class , who are on the verge of betraying brexit , feel the heat .
'we are mobilising the people 's army of this country that gave us victory in brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent , self-governing , proud united kingdom . '
meanwhile , remainers marched through birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre .
a smattering of activists waved tories against brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend .
labour peer lord adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened .
'these are the people who tell us they can have the it systems in place and all of the technology for canada plus plus , for the frictionless border , for free trade without borders in ireland , ' he added .
'it is a complete farce .
there isn 't such a thing as a good brexit , ' he added .
warren plans to take a ' hard look ' at running for president
u.s. sen. elizabeth warren says she 'll take a " hard look at running for president " after the november elections .
the boston globe reports the massachusetts democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western massachusetts saturday .
warren , a frequent critic of president donald trump , is running for re-election in november against gop state rep. geoff diehl , who was co-chairman of trump 's 2016 massachusetts campaign .

russian grand prix : lewis hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over sebastian vettel
it became clear from the moment that valtteri bottas qualified ahead of lewis hamilton on saturday that mercedes " team orders would play a large part in the race .
from pole , bottas got a good start and almost hung hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited vettel to attack his teammate .
vettel went into the pits first and left hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack , something which should have been decisive .
the mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind vettel , but hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner .
max verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday .
he then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake kimi raikkonen for fourth .
he eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as raikkonen took fourth .
it 's a difficult day because valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by .
the team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two , " said hamilton .
that was really bad body language
president donald trump mocked senator dianne feinstein at a rally on saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from christine blasey ford accusing supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh of sexual assault .
speaking at a rally in west virginia , the president did not directly address the testimony given by ford before the senate judiciary committee , instead commenting that what was going on in the senate showed that people were " mean and nasty and untruthful . "
" the one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the senate , when you see the anger , when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful , " he said .
" when you look at releases and leaks and then they say " oh , i didn 't do it .
i didn 't do it . "
remember ?
dianne feinstein , did you leak ?
remember her answer ... did you leak the document - " oh , oh , what ?
oh , no .
i didn 't leak . "
well , wait one minute .
did we leak ... no , we didn 't leak , " he added , in an impression of the senator .
feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against kavanaugh by ford back in july , and it was leaked earlier in september - but feinstein denied that the leak came from her office .
" i did not hide dr. ford 's allegations , i did not leak her story , " feinstein told the committee , the hill reported .
" she asked me to hold it confidential and i kept it confidential as she asked . "
but her denial did not appear to sit well with the president , who commented during the saturday night rally : " i 'll tell you what , that was really bad body language .
maybe she didn 't , but that 's the worst body language i 've ever seen . "
continuing his defense of the supreme court nominee , who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women , the president suggested that the democrats were using the allegations for their own ends .
" they are determined to take back power by any means necessary .
you see the meanness , the nastiness , they don 't care who they hurt , who they have to run over to get power and control , " mediaite reported the president saying .

he stayed put to make sure that the batik air flight 6321 , which was on the runway at the time , was able to take off safely .
he then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing .
he died later in hospital .
spokesman for air navigation indonesia , yohannes sirait , said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives , australia 's abc news reported .
we prepared a helicopter from balikpapan in kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city .
unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached palu .
" our heart breaks to hear about this , " he added .
meanwhile , authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country 's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the the towns of donggala , sigi and boutong is limited .
" the toll is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached , " agency spokesman sutopo purwo nugroho said .
waves that reached up to six meters have devastated palu which will hold a mass burial on sunday .
military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies .
risa kusuma , a 35-year-old mother , told sky news : " every minute an ambulance brings in bodies .

the mini-markets are looted everywhere . "
jan gelfand , head of the international red cross in indonesia , told cnn : " the indonesian red cross is racing to help survivors but we don 't know what they 'll find there .
this is already a tragedy , but it could get much worse . "
indonesia 's president joko widodo arrived in palu on sunday and told the country 's military : " i am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every tasks related to the evacuation .
are you ready ? " cnn reported .

ny nanny sues couple over firing after " racist " text
a new york nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was " another black person . "
the couple deny they are racist , likening the suit to " extortion . "
lynsey plasco-flaxman , a mother of two , expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider , giselle maurice , was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016 .
" nooooooooooo another black person , " wrote mrs plasco-flaxman to her husband in a text .
however , instead of sending it to her husband , she sent it to ms. maurice , twice .
after realizing her gaffe , an " uncomfortable " plasco-flaxman fired ms. maurice , stating that their outgoing nanny , who was african-american , had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a filipino , according to the new york post .
ms. maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an uber .
now , maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing , and is seeking compensation to the tune of $ 350 a day for the six-month , live-in gig she had initially been hired to do , albeit without a contract .
" i want to show them , look , you don 't do stuff like that , " she told the post on friday , adding " i know it 's discrimination . "
the couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist , saying that terminating maurice 's employment was the reasonable thing to do , fearing they could not trust her after offending her .
" my wife had sent her something that she didn 't mean to say .
she 's not a racist .
we 're not racist people , " husband joel plasco told the post .
" but would you put your children in the hands of someone you 've been rude to , even if it was by mistake ?
your newborn baby ?
come on . "
likening the suit to " extortion , " plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a " very difficult situation . "
" you 're going to go after someone like that ?
that 's not a very nice thing to do , " the investment banker added .
while the legal case is still ongoing , the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media , slamming them for their behavior and logic .
grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives .
sharon davis and kelly humphreys have been posting cards on a welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support .
ms davis ' son tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18 .
" i don 't want any parent to feel the way i have to feel everyday , " she said .
ms davis , aged 45 , who lives in lydney , said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin .
" everyone knew him for his smile .
they always said his smile lit up any room . "
however , he gave up work before he died , as he was " in a really dark place . "
in 2014 , tyler 's brother , who was 11 at the time , was the one to find his sibling after he had taken his own life .
ms davis said : " i continually worry that there 's going to be a knock on effect . "
ms davis created the cards , " to let people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to , even if it 's a friend .
don 't sit in silence - you need to talk . "
ms humphreys , who has been friends with ms davies for years , lost mark , her partner of 15 years , not long after the death of his mother .
" he didn 't say that he was feeling down or depressed or anything , " she said .
" a couple of days before christmas we noticed his change in attitude .
he was at rock bottom on christmas day - when the kids opened their presents he didn 't make eye contact with them or anything . "
she said his death was a huge trauma to them , but they have to work through it : " it rips a hole through the family .
it tears us apart .
but we 've all got to carry on and fight . "

and women need to wield it .
it is a righteous diatribe , months and years of fury spilling over , and she can 't get it out without weeping .
" we cry when we get angry , " ms. steinem said to me 45 years later .
" i don 't think that 's uncommon , do you ? "
she continued , " i was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace , who said she also cried when she got angry , but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry , she 'd say to the person she was talking to , " you may think i am sad because i am crying .
i am angry . "
and then she just kept going .
and i thought that was brilliant . "
tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood .
one of my sharpest memories from an early job , in a male-dominated office , where i once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage , was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom i 'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell .
" never let them see you crying , " she told me .
" they don 't know you 're furious .
they think you 're sad and will be pleased because they got to you . "
patricia schroeder , then a democratic congresswoman from colorado , had worked with gary hart on his presidential runs .
in 1987 , when mr. hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called monkey business and bowed out of the race , ms. schroeder , deeply frustrated , figured there was no reason she shouldn 't explore the idea of running for president herself .
" it was not a well-thought-out decision , " she said to me with a laugh 30 years later .
" there were already seven other candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another one .
somebody called it " snow white and the seven dwarfs . " "
because it was late in the campaign , she was behind on fund-raising , and so she vowed that she wouldn 't enter the race unless she raised $ 2 million .
it was a losing battle .
she discovered that some of her supporters who gave $ 1,000 to men would give her only $ 250 .
" do they think i get a discount ? " she wondered .
when she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who 'd supported her , frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates , and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up .
" you would have thought i 'd had a nervous breakdown , " recalled ms. schroeder about how the press reacted to her .
" you 'd have thought kleenex was my corporate sponsor .
i remember thinking , what are they going to put on my tombstone ?
" she cried " ? " "
how the us-china trade war may be good for beijing
the opening salvos of the trade war between the us and china were deafening , and while the battle is far from over , a rift between the countries may be beneficial to beijing in the long term , experts say .
donald trump , the us president , fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key chinese exports including solar panels , steel and aluminium .
the most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $ 200 billion ( <unk> 150 billion ) worth of items , effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the us from china .
beijing has retaliated each time in kind , most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $ 60 billion of american goods .
china has pledged to match the us shot-for-shot , and the world 's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon .
getting washington to back down means caving into demands , but publicly bowing to the us would be far too embarrassing for xi jinping , china 's president .
still , experts say if beijing can play its cards right , us trade war pressures could positively support china over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies .
" the fact that a quick political decision in either washington or beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before , " said abigail grace , a research associate who focuses on asia at the center for new american security , a think tank .

another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance .
al-moualem said the syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country .
but he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency .

gorgeous celebration in all the cities and residential areas of kazakhstan of the 100th anniversary of bloodthirsty red butchers of leninist komsomol is a shame for our country , brothers .
this , first of all , means komsomols ' slap in the face of the independence of the kazakh country .
yesterday the information about the great celebration of the 100th anniversary of red butchers trying their best by the initiators , heads of former komsomol , followers initiated by today 's red butchers nurlan omarov in semey , the birthplace of " alashorda " standing at the origins of kazakh statehood was released .
i was surprised to see pioneers wearing a red tie on the internet in kazakhstan schools .
now having seen these russified , i.e. slaves with no origin started to poison openly the conscious of kazakh young generation i found nothing to say ... what a horror !
how can we understand this komsomol 's backtrack from the independence of kazakh country , saying we are russian slaves ?
oh , horror , slave 's name is a slave !
we need to understand that recognition by those tasmagambetov , aitimova , sultanov in fact that they are colonizers ' slaves , open expression of their endless love towards russia is an open recognition of the dependence of today 's followers of yesterday red butchers first of all to russia which we thought to be vanished into thin air up to date .
in 1986 , i still remember dishonest actions of those current " forever deputies " : k.sultanov , b.aitimova during famous december events in 1986 dished on d.konayev who helped them raise in their careers to gennady kolbin , grieving and crying , now they told about those participating in december events : " comrade kolbin , i will bring those bitches you to punish them , " and i was the one to write about this grief in my epos " zobalan " ( outrages ) , during the soviet empire , in particular , in 1990 , made one-hour long radio play in munich , and i am the author of the famous writing traveling the world , akyn zhumash kokbori !
the kazakh nation also did not forget who involuntarily quietened down at that time !
as the citizen of independent kazakhstan , as the child of the kazakh nation , i will accuse openly the followers of those red butchers !
if our country is independent indeed , i will openly talk that the day born to punish them as the state betrayers constituting a threat openly to the independence of kazakhstan of forever president of this country as the whole people !
" my nation , my kazakh , my poor people " ( abay ) , it is the moment to openly punish these red butcher komsomol as the whole nation .
wake up , kazakhs , history will never forgive your next quiescency .
never forget this , kazakhs !

arkhimed mukhambetov about changing kostanay region into torgay .
akim of kostanay region arkhimed mambetov expressed his opinion concerning the initiative about naming kostanay region as torgay region .
today the question concerning an open letter about changing the name of the region of the initiative group has been put at the briefing held in astana .
i have familiarized myself with the letter .
i have seen it .
in general , i am against it .
because kostanay region has its own name from history .
if i am not mistaken , 17 people signed this letter .
i know a few people .
when i talked to them in person , sabyrzhan akhmetuly who was akim in many districts refused it saying " i have not signed this letter . "
kalibek deripsaldin ( composer ) said that he also had not signed this letter .
for this reason , i believe that disturbing people is not correct , - arkhimed mukhambetov said .
the regional akim reminded that there is an order of changing the name of the residential area , and hearings must be held .
so , we will see .
but , in general , there is my viewpoint .
we have the center of the district formed with torgay name , coming from long since .
if in 30s , 40s the name of kostanay city was torgay , then the works on returning the previous name would be reasonable .
but i am against it , it is my viewpoint - arkhimed mukhambetov concluded .
