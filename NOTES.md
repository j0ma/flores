- old log files from azure/aws located in `./log/old_from_awsazure`
- all training encapsulated in `train.sh`
    - goal: running "make train" should do all the training
- makefile contains two targets:
    - `make init` does all the data folder initialization
    - `make train` does all the training
    - `make evaluate` does all the evaluation
    - `make all` does init -> train -> evaluate
- if want to use custom checkpoints folder need to pass it as arg to make
